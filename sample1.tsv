160	5640	61% of people feel expected to just get over stress.
5640	7800	Yeah, it's like just power through the moment.
7800	11640	CEO of Calm, author of Recharge, David Code.
11640	13720	Good stress could lead to resilience.
13720	14720	You're never really gonna have
14720	16520	a stress-free work environment.
16520	20640	Not everything has to be 24-7, 365,
20640	23320	because at some point you've caused a lot of bad stress.
23320	25760	That's a real kind of indicator for you to say,
25760	28080	I need to really kind of take a hard stop
28080	30080	and figure out how I recharge.

59400	61040	for the last couple of years,
61040	65000	I'm talking about David Code, the CEO of Calm,

68440	72520	and a new author of his book, Recharge,

86680	88160	and feeling drained.

98360	101600	this book and episode is for you.
101600	103320	Please welcome to On Purpose,
103320	105960	the CEO of Calm, David Code.
105960	107680	David, it's great to have you here.
107680	109160	Thank you, Jay, for having me here today.
109160	110160	I'm so excited.
110160	112880	I'm so excited because I really feel like,
112880	115200	ever since we met, I felt like we hit it off.
115200	115960	Right away.
115960	117880	Yeah, right away, right away.
117880	119920	And I've been fortunate enough to have you
119920	121880	interview me so many times,
121880	126120	so I'm glad I get to repay the favor this time round.
126120	127240	And I wanted to ask you,
127240	129040	just to get our blood boiling,
129040	130240	just to start with some fun,
130240	132240	and I wanted to ask you, David,
132240	134720	what's something that you're not calm about?
134720	137440	I think there's a lot of things
137440	140160	that I'm not calm about throughout my day.
140160	142640	I will tell you right now,
142640	147120	I am in the throes of my oldest daughter
147120	149080	applying to colleges.
149080	152320	Even though I try to appear very calm in front of her
152320	154760	and cool and collective, you know?
154760	157880	And you don't want to be like a helicopter type of parent.
157880	159640	There are times where I'm just like,
159640	161800	you know, I want to get in there and say something,
161800	164560	but I realize almost like the best thing for her
164560	166400	is for her to go through it.
166400	168600	And I have to kind of take a backseat.
168600	171880	And so it's kind of going from where you take the wheel
171880	173560	to like you're in the passenger seat
173560	174640	and then you're in the backseat
174640	176840	kind of peering every once in a while.
176840	178560	But I can't help myself from like,
178560	180200	I don't know when she first learned to drive
180200	182640	by like saying, oh, I'm stepping on the brake
182640	183560	here and there, right?
183560	186080	But that's one thing right now
186080	188080	that is probably a little stressful.
188080	189440	Yeah, no, I can imagine.
189440	194080	I read a study that said we process around 72 gigabytes
194080	196400	of information per day,
196400	201200	which the research likened to reading Tolkien's The Hobbit
201200	202200	every single day.
202200	204480	That's nearly 96,000 words.
204480	205480	Right, right.
205480	207000	And you think about that and you go,
207000	208600	no wonder we're overwhelmed.
208600	209920	No wonder we're burnt out.
209920	211160	No wonder we're stressed.
211160	214040	And you have this really brilliant analogy
214040	217000	comparing the brain and our mind to a battery.
217000	217520	That's right.
217520	220200	Walk us through this because I really like this in your book,
220200	223000	Recharge, the way you break it down and explain it.
223000	226800	You know, the recharge came from a good friend of mine
226800	229800	and we were talking about mental health.
229800	231560	And I just asked her, I said, you know,
231560	233400	how's it going with your kids?
233400	235640	And she goes, you know, I was talking to my kids
235640	237760	and I just said, how's your battery?
237760	239560	And I was like, wait, what?
239560	241880	And she goes, well, I said, how's your battery?
241880	243280	I said, why?
243280	246160	And she said, well, if I ask them how they're doing,
246160	248880	I get the plane fine.
248880	251600	And because they're kids, they're just like, I'm fine.
251600	254520	But if I ask them, like, how's your battery?
254520	257080	They're like, well, it's at like 50%
257080	260000	or so you may need a snack because they're little.
260000	262200	Or it's at 75% there.
262200	263520	She's like, oh, you're OK.
263520	265160	Or sometimes they're at 25%
265160	268080	and they just need something to decompress.
268080	271440	While we were talking about it, a light bulb just went out.
271440	273840	And that light bulb that went on was about like,
274320	276720	she took something that at times can be charged
277280	280640	and she took something and really simplified in a way
280640	283320	that I think we would all understand, regardless of age.
283960	285920	And I asked her, I was like, can I run with that?
285920	288280	And she was like, yeah, sure, whatever, right?
288280	290160	And we still laugh about it, Brenda and I,
290160	291720	because she's like, wow, you actually took it.
291720	294160	And I was like, yeah, I used it as a theme.
294160	295640	I talk about it.
295640	297560	I go to clients.
297560	299920	I go out and it just kind of resonates with people
299920	301320	because it's simple.
301320	304400	And it doesn't kind of draw out any emotions.
304400	305800	It just says like, hey, how's your battery?
305800	307120	How are you feeling?
307120	310320	And I think that sometimes that gets lost
310320	313800	because we try to make it bigger sometimes than it is.
314360	316920	And it's really nice when you can kind of just simplify it
316920	318600	and just ask you, how's your battery?
318600	319240	How are you doing?
319240	321000	I love the question, how's your battery,
321000	323880	even more than how you're doing, like you said.
323880	328360	Because I think sometimes we, I think you also mentioned
328360	330680	that we can scale everything up to a 10.
330680	331280	That's right.
331280	334880	So everything can feel like it's a 10, it's the worst.
334880	337840	Or everything can feel like, oh, it's just plain old fine.
337840	338480	That's right.
338480	340560	And then you don't have much to play with.
340560	342680	Whereas when you get a number, walk us through the different
342680	344400	breakdowns as you do in the book.
344400	344880	Yeah.
344880	347200	Because I think when you look at zero to a hundred,
348240	352800	we're very good at feeling zero and maybe a hundred, right?
352800	356880	Like if it's your kid's wedding, chances are you'll be at a hundred.
356880	359680	If it's like your kid's birthday, like you're at a hundred.
359680	363200	Like there's these joyful, blissful moments in life
363200	366400	that people experience and we go, yeah, that was a hundred moment.
366400	368640	And then we all know what a zero moment feels like.
368640	371680	You lost a loved one who sadly passed away.
371680	374320	You got, you know, you lost your job.
374320	376800	Like there's these very zero moments.
377360	379760	Walk us through how you break down the zero to a hundred.
379760	381760	Yeah. And I tried to do it really simply.
381760	385200	You know, I have found, and I'll talk about my own kids at times.
385920	388640	When I asked them that question, how their battery is,
389440	392720	I noticed that they check, like most people,
392720	394080	they check their phones quite often.
394800	396800	And at some point it just becomes like a reflex
397360	398800	and they don't even know they're checking it.
399360	401520	But when they do look at it and the power's down
401520	405920	or it goes yellow or it goes red, they get a little panicked.
405920	407200	Like, oh my God, I got to charge it.
408400	410960	Imagine my surprise when we're in like airports
410960	412560	and they're like going out to people,
412560	414720	can I use a little of your charge, right?
414720	415680	I think we've all been there.
415680	417440	We don't have a charger and usually like,
417440	418400	I need something.
418400	419360	Can somebody help me out?
420080	422080	Most times people are really kind and they'll just,
422080	423920	you know, kind of help you, especially if you're a kid.
424800	427280	I thought about then putting it into zones
427280	428880	and I put it into four zones.
428880	431760	And I just said, you know, if you're at 75 to 100,
432480	433360	you're probably fine.
434000	436720	And meaning that, you know, you're in a zone
436720	437840	where you're just moving along.
438640	442400	If you're at 50 to 75, you're probably in a place
442400	445280	where you might need to start to think about
445280	447280	how you may want to recharge.
448160	450240	If you're in that 25 to 50,
450800	453120	it's time to start figuring out, take a break.
453120	454560	You may need to take a walk.
454560	456560	You may need to put down the phone.
456560	459440	You may need to stop the litany of Zoom calls
459440	460800	that you're on right now, right?
461440	463760	And if you find yourself zero to 25,
464400	466880	that's a real kind of indicator for you to say,
466880	468880	hey, something's probably not right.
469600	472480	And I need to really kind of take a hard stop
472480	474080	and figure out how I recharge.
474080	476480	And recharge can happen in a number of different ways.
477200	479840	And so I've often talked about
479840	481280	when I've gotten into that zone,
481920	483760	I just kind of almost go for a walk.
484880	486160	I sometimes go outside.
486720	487760	I take some deep breaths.
488320	489440	I do a number of things.
489440	490800	Sometimes I may need a workout.
490800	493680	A workout really helps me to recharge on a personal front.
494320	496080	And everyone's a little bit different
496080	497760	and they'll go to different techniques.
497760	499760	And so in the book, I list a lot of things
499760	500960	in the book that you may do.
501600	504080	You may do one, two, three, four, or all of them.
504640	506320	And they're just really techniques
506320	508320	for you to figure out what works for you.
509280	511600	Yeah, no, and I really like that breakdown
511600	513680	because I think we're all better
513680	515440	when we're measuring things with numbers.
515440	515840	That's right.
515840	517120	There's a specificity there.
517120	517760	Yeah, yeah.
517760	519040	And I'm one of those people,
519040	521440	I think the way your phone is charged
521440	523280	says so much about you as a person.
523280	525200	So my phone is always charged.
525200	525680	Yeah.
525680	530320	I'm very rarely below 30% or 40% on my phone.
530960	534080	And I think I try and monitor my personal health
534080	535120	in a similar way.
535120	535600	Right.
535600	538080	As soon as I feel myself going below 50%,
539040	541120	I know it's time for an early night.
541120	543680	I know it's time to cancel weekend plans.
543680	546560	I canceled a dinner this evening for that exact reason.
546560	546960	Mm-hmm.
546960	548640	I got back from work yesterday.
549120	552160	I left, I started work yesterday at like 8.30 a.m.
552160	555680	and I got back from a shoot at 9.30 p.m.
556480	558320	And I knew I had a dinner tonight.
558320	561440	And I just said, I'm so sorry, I can't make it.
561440	561920	Good for you.
561920	563280	Because I knew I had a busy day today.
563280	563920	I was interviewing you.
563920	565440	I was interviewing another guest.
565440	567280	And I was like, I want to be really present for that.
567280	569120	It's really critical stuff.
569120	571920	And then I need to recharge using your word.
571920	573520	I need to recharge this evening.
574160	577600	And I'm always shifting things to recharge.
577600	580720	And I love that idea because I think we hear the word rest.
581280	583040	And then sometimes we feel guilty.
583040	584400	We shouldn't, but we feel guilty.
584400	585840	Like, I don't have time to rest.
585840	586400	Yeah.
586400	588240	But when you think of it about recharging,
588240	590800	you're reframing it and going, oh, I do need to recharge.
590800	593360	Because otherwise, how am I going to give my best tomorrow?
593360	594080	100%.
594080	594640	100%.
594640	595920	And you know, it's funny.
595920	597680	You and me are the same on batteries.
597680	599920	I keep my battery pretty charged as well.
599920	601680	I have an electric car too.
601680	605520	I marvel at people who could take that electric car battery down to 5%.
605520	606320	I can't do it.
606320	608080	That stresses me out.
608080	610240	I'm stressed out when they tell me these stories.
610240	611920	Oh, I took the battery down to 5%.
611920	613600	I'm like, seriously?
613600	614240	How?
614240	615840	I mean, and they're like, oh, it's fine.
616560	618000	And for some people, it works, right?
618000	619440	For me, that doesn't work.
619440	621520	I'm plugging in that battery every night.
621520	624160	And I'm going to make sure I charge that battery up.
624160	625680	Others will let it go pretty low.
625680	627040	Everyone's a little bit different.
627040	627920	That works for them.
628800	631520	I've asked some of my friends who charge it go really low.
631520	634240	And they're like, well, if I charge it too much, I get stressed.
634240	636800	I'm like, oh, OK, it can work the other way.
636800	637680	Interesting.
637680	642000	So it's got to kind of work for you and how you want to recharge
642000	644000	and different techniques that you want to do.
644000	646800	You're never really going to have a stress-free work environment.
646800	650000	Anxiety, depression, and then starts to lead to physical ailments
650000	651920	because we know there's a linkage.
651920	654800	Good stress could lead to resilience.
654800	656320	It could lead to growth.
656320	658640	It actually could lead to a stronger culture.
658640	660800	I was wondering if someone's at a zero,
660800	662400	when you ask them, how's your battery?
662400	662960	Yeah.
662960	666480	And if someone says, I'm at five and I'm talking about emotionally,
666480	668480	mentally, not their car or their phone,
670000	670880	what would you say to them?
670880	675520	How would you communicate with them some of these tools
675520	676720	when you're at zero?
676720	681280	I've learned to, like, take the space to give them space
681280	683360	so we can actually have a proper conversation.
684240	687440	If you find someone at a really low percentage,
687440	689760	and I may ask that person, like, how are you doing?
689760	693440	How are you feeling? And most of the time, you just want a,
693440	695920	I'm good, because then you just want to keep going.
696640	699040	And I find that often in the business world as well,
699040	701200	not just in the personal world, but in the business world.
701200	703520	We don't want a response,
704240	707360	or sometimes we don't have the time to be like,
707360	710560	if that person who you're asking the question to says,
710560	713680	I'm not doing so hot and I'm not doing so well,
713680	714400	then what do you do?
715040	718400	So I'm very intentional when I ask some of these questions
718960	720720	to individuals so that I give,
721280	723840	I'm ready for that response if it's, I'm not doing well,
723840	725760	like a 5%. So I kind of want to frame it there.
725760	726560	I love that. Yeah.
726560	728880	I think sometimes you rush through these conversations.
729440	732080	And then when they do tell you they're a 5 or a 10,
732080	734160	I think the best things that I have found
734160	735520	is you have to be present for them.
736160	736960	You have to listen.
736960	738960	You do such a brilliant job at that, Jay,
738960	741600	because even in this type of environment,
741600	743680	we know as we have this one-to-one conversation,
743680	746480	if I was telling you I was a 5 or a 0,
746480	749200	you'd be all in on this and you would hear me out.
749200	750960	And then you would start to tell me,
750960	753440	okay, let's talk about what's causing that.
754240	757680	And I've had at times where family members have come to me and said,
757680	759120	hey, I'm at a 5.
760080	761840	And we start to break it down.
761840	763840	And I said, let me put it in another way for you.
764480	765280	Think about your phone.
765280	767600	And we do checks on our phone.
768160	770800	And there's things on your phone that drain your battery
770800	772160	more than other applications.
772160	774400	And they're like, yeah, it's like when you go and
774400	777120	Apple shows you what's draining or taking up all your memory.
777680	780080	And what happens when you start to delete some of those things?
780720	784080	Or what happens when you start to recognize what's causing it?
784080	786960	They're like, oh, my battery is much more efficient.
786960	788080	And I'm like, yeah.
788080	791760	So what's causing that in your personal life right now?
791760	792400	Yeah.
792400	796160	And we try to create like, you know, analogies of different things.
796160	801280	And so it doesn't become a space where all we're doing is talking about all the negativity.
801280	804960	We're trying to draw parallels to different things in everyday life.
805520	808640	And so that it doesn't become such a charged conversation.
808640	808960	Yeah.
808960	809280	Right.
809280	812240	And that's kind of the recharge concept as well, where we're like,
812240	814320	let's talk, let's talk about your mental health.
814320	817040	Because sometimes some people don't want to talk about their mental health.
817040	817600	Mm-hmm.
817600	820880	But when we bring up the battery conversation or how to recharge,
820880	822640	it's just a different framing.
822640	826400	And again, this is something I think you just do brilliantly to bring everyone in.
827200	829920	And I try to do the same thing there as well.
829920	830160	Yeah.
830160	832880	I was going to ask you that, actually, because I've always felt that with you.
833520	837600	You've always been present at different touch points, whether we're at dinners, events,
838560	841760	even when we've traveled and seen each other when we're in New York for a dinner,
841760	843040	for time earlier this year.
843040	845360	You're always present, too.
845360	847360	And I wonder, how do you do that as a busy CEO?
847360	851840	Because I think you're so right that when we ask the question, how are you doing,
852880	856960	we are subconsciously hoping someone just says, I'm good.
857600	863600	We are all, we almost ask the question and expect the response even before we have a response.
863600	864240	You're so right.
864240	865760	Like, that really resonated with me.
866480	870560	And the truth is, sometimes life is fast for most of us, right?
870560	872720	Our schedules are back to back to back.
872720	878400	We are running from dropping your kid to school, running to work, picking up the laundry,
878400	880160	doing the laundry, whatever, right?
880160	881280	There's so much going on.
882080	887040	How do you actually create space for these conversations?
887040	890720	And that's part of being a lot more present and intentional.
891200	895360	As leaders, and I'd be curious now for you as CEO as well,
896480	898160	we're expected to have all the answers.
899040	901840	We're expected to make many different types of decisions.
902480	905920	We're expected to play roles in HR, but also company strategy.
906560	909440	And, you know, when you take a step back, you can't make every decision.
910160	913280	And then there's always things that don't, that are the unexpected.
913760	915040	Take your car analogy.
915040	918800	So when you had your car and you were at 30%, you were probably with someone.
918800	921440	But in the back of your mind, you're going, how am I going to get home?
922080	923120	Where am I going to charge?
924080	928480	And you could do this probably better than most, but you still want to be present for that
928480	932240	individual that you're with or your friends that you're with in those conversations.
932960	936880	And what I find is like, sometimes we as leaders have to make the space.
937840	943200	Sometimes we as leaders have to show something that you do absolutely brilliantly is to show
943200	946320	a vulnerable side to them and talk about our own stories.
946880	950560	I find that many CEOs today aren't vulnerable.
951120	953680	I, for one, was not very good at being vulnerable.
954240	962480	When I wrote the book though, I was just taken back at how many people who I met for the first time
962480	966320	were so open and honest and vulnerable with myself.
967200	971520	And it got me thinking, well, if they can do it, why can't I do it?
972240	972560	Right?
972560	979280	And if I started to show some of that vulnerability at work, if I started to give a little bit of space
979280	985840	and more time for that conversation, would that then make it just more open for others
985840	988480	and more safe for others to have the conversation?
989120	993120	Because if I, if I'm not having that conversation and saying, here's my own journey,
994000	997600	then they may feel that it's not okay for them to open up as well.
998160	998400	Right?
999120	1001200	I just be curious, like you as CEO, right?
1001200	1003520	You're, I mean, you've got all these different businesses.
1003520	1005040	How do you do that with your own employees?
1005040	1009360	Yeah, I think it's a, for me, it comes to the balance.
1009360	1011280	So vulnerability is a great point.
1011280	1017360	And, and I really appreciate that because I do agree that if you create space to share
1017360	1021600	what you're going through with your teams, they then have the permission to do the same.
1021600	1027120	And I think I was mentioning when we did a panel at Calm Coast a month ago or so,
1027840	1033920	I was talking about a client of mine that I was coaching, who's the CEO of a very large corporation.
1034640	1039040	And we'd gone through a transformation. They were saying to me, Jay, I'm, you know,
1039040	1042000	I'm feeling good. And I was like, great. Well, you should tell your team about your journey.
1042000	1043280	And they were like, how can I tell them?
1043280	1043680	Right.
1043680	1046080	And I said, what do you mean? And they said, well, if I tell them,
1046080	1048320	they're going to think I'm weak. And I was like, no, I promise you,
1048320	1049600	they're going to think you're strong.
1050240	1055920	And I think we're still redefining and reframing strength in the world today.
1055920	1062880	I think there are some of us who still see bravado and arrogance and chauvinism as being strong.
1063760	1067120	And I think that's shifting, but it's shifting very slowly.
1067120	1068640	That's right.
1068640	1076640	It is a cultural expectation as well, societal expectation of strength being this kind of facade.
1076640	1078640	But I think a lot of us are now realizing, well, no,
1078640	1083200	strength is being able to show both sides and open up and be vulnerable.
1083200	1088160	I think the other thing that really comes to mind when I'm thinking about being CEO is,
1088720	1091840	I think stress can make people work harder,
1093120	1096640	but it's the right amount of stress that makes someone work better.
1096640	1097600	So good. So true.
1097600	1099520	Right? There's a spectrum of stress.
1099520	1100320	So true, so good.
1100320	1102640	If I just keep checking in with someone and go, have you done it yet?
1103200	1106960	Are you done yet? Why are we not there yet? Why did the numbers not triple this?
1106960	1110320	If I do that, they're going to feel stressed and they may work harder,
1110320	1111600	but that doesn't mean they work better.
1111600	1112160	That's right.
1112160	1115760	And so to me, the right amount of stress, and I want to ask you this as well,
1116400	1121440	talk to me about the difference between good stress and bad stress and how you've been able
1121440	1124400	to harness the right amount when you've got it right.
1124400	1129600	In the book, actually, I interviewed Dr. Aditi Nurikar and you met her.
1129600	1130560	Yeah. She's wonderful.
1130560	1131520	Fantastic. Right.
1132160	1135600	And we got into this whole conversation of good stress, bad stress.
1136320	1139600	You stress, good stress versus bad stress, distress.
1139600	1145760	And, you know, we talked about how good stress could lead to resilience.
1145760	1147280	It could lead to growth.
1147280	1149280	It actually could lead to a stronger culture.
1150560	1153280	You're never really going to have a stress-free work environment.
1153280	1153840	Agreed.
1153840	1155600	You know, we're always going to have stress at work.
1156160	1157440	We're all going to have deadlines.
1157440	1159920	We're all going to have things we're going to want to hit.
1159920	1166000	But not everything has to be, just like you said, 24-7, 365.
1166640	1171920	Because at some point, it's going to stack so much that you as a leader are realizing you're
1171920	1173440	probably not being very efficient.
1173440	1178480	Your employees are probably not working super efficiently, not working well together.
1178480	1182000	And they're probably, you've caused a lot of bad stress, distress in their life.
1182000	1186320	That's leading to things like anxiety, depression, and then starts to lead to physical ailments.
1186320	1192160	Because we know there's a linkage between, you know, your mental health and your physical health.
1192160	1196080	And so that becomes a very vicious cycle, especially in the workplace.
1196080	1199040	And that leads to a lot of unproductivity.
1199040	1204560	What I've found with the two is you really have to find that right balance and understand there
1204560	1206960	will be, and just talk about it.
1206960	1207680	There's a push.
1207680	1208800	We're all going to make a push.
1209440	1214400	We did it recently as a company at Calm around the elections.
1214960	1220000	And we treated the elections like our Super Bowl moment because we knew, and we saw the data,
1220000	1225760	that people's stress was rising every day as that day, November 5th, got closer and closer.
1225760	1226800	We saw it in the App Store.
1226800	1227760	We saw it in comments.
1227760	1229520	We saw it on social.
1229520	1235200	So we really came together as a company to do different types of things around that.
1235200	1238160	Take a breath, 30 seconds or 15 seconds of silence.
1239280	1244240	We showed animals from the San Diego Zoo on Instagram.
1244240	1248800	And we got so many people commenting that day that said, hey, thank you for the silence.
1249520	1255120	Thank you for my 15 seconds in this world where so many things are happening.
1255120	1258800	Now, people were dialing in from work because they were stressed at work.
1258800	1260480	Stress doesn't just mean it's at home.
1260480	1263280	It was like people were like during the elections coming in from work.
1263280	1267920	And so we wanted to give them a little bit so they had a release so they could be more productive.
1268480	1274080	So there's a lot of things around stuff that I look at for good stress and bad stress and recognize
1274080	1278800	there's always going to be a push-pull, but that's the part where you can't do it alone.
1278800	1279760	You got to have a good team.
1279760	1280720	You got to talk about it.
1280720	1286480	You do this so well and make sure that becomes part of your fabric, your culture, your DNA.
1287280	1290800	And I think it's shifting, but it's slow.
1290800	1291440	Yeah.
1291440	1294480	I think the conversation around mental health in everyday life,
1295600	1298720	it's the most approachable it's ever been, right?
1298720	1301680	I talk about things with my own kids today around mental health.
1302320	1306560	When I was a child coming, you know, I'd be curious, like for you, like immigrant family,
1307120	1310080	we didn't talk about our mental health in my household, right?
1310080	1314000	We talked more about powering through things and I can talk about that later,
1314000	1315440	but we didn't really talk about it.
1315440	1319680	My kids talk about it. They may overuse it at times, not use it the right way.
1320480	1322640	It's okay. They're having the conversation.
1322640	1325360	Their friends are having the conversation. I think that's great.
1326320	1330480	But when you go to the workplace, it kind of stops, you know?
1330480	1333760	And I go to so many places and I'm like, do you talk about your mental health at work?
1333760	1334400	And they're like, no.
1335120	1337280	And I'm like, well, let's change that dialogue.
1337840	1341120	Let's make it as approachable as it is in everyday life.
1341120	1344560	And how do we start to do that? Let's give you the tools and we'll start at the top.
1344560	1346160	Yeah, you're so right. You're so right.
1346160	1352080	What you're painting a picture of for me is that I look at the good stress being
1352080	1354640	when we all know what challenge we're up against.
1355360	1358800	We know what the goal is and everyone feels supported.
1359360	1363680	And I think what often happens is people don't know what the goal is
1363680	1365680	because you're not helping them do that.
1365680	1368720	They only see the challenge and they don't feel supported.
1368720	1369440	That's right.
1369440	1374080	So now they don't know where they're going and they feel if they fall flat on their face,
1374080	1375360	they have nothing to catch them.
1375360	1376160	That's right.
1376160	1380640	As a leader, the goal is to provide the goal and the support.
1380640	1382720	And then the person can focus on the challenge.
1382720	1385120	Yeah. And be transparent in that journey.
1385120	1389600	You know, I speak to many CEOs in the Valley and over the world.
1389600	1394160	And, you know, a lot of times I'll ask them, how do you prioritize things with your employees?
1394160	1395760	How transparent are you?
1395760	1398320	And I'll tell you, many of them are not that transparent.
1398320	1400240	Or they'll be like, these are the most important things.
1401200	1404240	And then they'll add five more and then five more.
1404240	1405600	Right. And I'll be like, oh, okay.
1406320	1407520	What did you take away?
1408160	1409360	And they're like, what are you talking about?
1409360	1411680	I mean, what did you take away?
1412480	1414880	And they're like, nothing.
1415440	1418400	And I'm like, well, how do you think that's affecting your employees?
1419040	1421120	And they're like, I never really thought about that.
1421680	1426800	So I've just compounded and stacked the problem as a leader.
1426800	1433600	And you didn't take anything away and it cascades down like a megaphone.
1434240	1439040	Think about what that employee is going through and walk in their shoes for a minute.
1439760	1445040	You know, we at the top have the luxury of having more control over our schedules.
1446080	1448800	But that person may not have as much control over their schedule.
1448800	1450480	They're just ticking through things.
1450480	1450960	Yeah.
1450960	1456240	And if you just keep adding and not taking certain things away and saying, this is important.
1456240	1457360	This isn't important.
1457360	1458400	Here's how I think about it.
1458400	1459760	Here's how I'm being transparent.
1460480	1462240	You're adding more stress to your company.
1462240	1465200	You know, leaders struggle with how to be vulnerable.
1465200	1466560	Is it going to be used against me?
1466560	1467040	Yeah.
1467040	1469360	Is someone going to write about it and say I'm too weak?
1469360	1472480	Is the board going to think I'm weak as a leader?
1472480	1476800	That's ultimately also a fail of corporate stewardship.
1476800	1479520	Because they have to also look after your mental health.
1479520	1481120	At Calm, I love this.
1481120	1486400	When I first got introduced to Calm and started taking calls with the teams
1486400	1490640	and I took my role of chief purpose officer, I got integrated into the culture.
1491520	1496880	I loved the little things and the focus on the little things at meetings at Calm,
1496880	1498880	whether they're on Zoom, in person.
1498880	1504240	I want to hear about these smaller things that are happening on a daily basis.
1504240	1507840	Because I think often companies think they need to put out a thing that says,
1507840	1511360	we're focusing on company mental health and they're doing these big things.
1511360	1516320	But Calm internally, let alone the work they do with other companies and workplaces,
1516320	1523040	but Calm internally had some really nice cultural things that I noticed from the outside in
1523040	1524720	as I was being integrated.
1524720	1528640	Walk us through some of those daily things that you think create the rituals and practices
1528880	1529840	that help people.
1529840	1535360	It was interesting for me, my first day at Calm, I walk in and they're Michael and Alex,
1535360	1536880	who you know well, the founders, right?
1536880	1537520	Yeah, I love them.
1537520	1540720	And they love you and they talk about you all the time and how you all first met.
1541600	1546960	And they introduced me to the company, warm welcome, so inviting.
1547600	1551040	And they started the whole all hands off with a meditation.
1552640	1553920	And I wasn't really used to that.
1554800	1559920	You know, and I was I was kind of sitting there and I kind of noticed everyone.
1559920	1562160	And normally we listen to someone like yourself.
1562160	1566000	We'll turn you on or we'll turn one of our other kind of narrators on.
1566000	1566720	They do great.
1567280	1569520	And everyone just kind of sat there in the moment.
1569520	1572560	And whether it was sometimes it's, you know, really quick, 30 seconds,
1572560	1574960	sometimes it's five, six minutes, something three minutes.
1575760	1580160	And they listened and it was and I kind of was peeking at times looking.
1580160	1584000	I'm like, is everyone kind of closing their eyes, you know, around here, you know, looking there.
1584000	1586480	And they were just in the moment.
1586480	1589440	It was a moment for me that showed me how much they cared.
1590160	1591840	And I was like, wow, this company cares.
1592560	1593840	This isn't forced.
1593840	1594960	You don't have to be here.
1594960	1596480	You don't have to do this.
1596480	1599120	And they were there and they were present and they were in the moment.
1599920	1600960	So that's like some of this.
1600960	1603680	That was one of the ways I knew this company was going to be different.
1604560	1610880	And then I watched as the company did things around gratitude, where we end every all hands
1610880	1611680	with gratitude.
1612240	1617680	We read things that have come into us and it's a reminder of the impact we're having.
1618400	1624720	And I think that's why sometimes I'm so stressed because I feel this weight of responsibility
1625280	1628160	where every second of every day someone is using the product.
1628880	1635280	And I just feel like if we're not answering them or not helping them in the moment,
1635280	1636960	someone's not getting something that they need.
1637920	1641040	And I feel that stress and I feel the response.
1641040	1642240	It's really responsibility.
1642240	1642560	Yeah.
1642560	1644880	And I talk about that with the employees.
1645440	1647360	And I think it's really important to talk about that.
1647360	1649120	So we do the gratitude piece at the end.
1649680	1655120	We have zoom free days, you know, where I talk to employees about,
1655120	1660400	hey, if you're in a moment where you find yourself in five zooms, take a beat.
1660960	1662080	You don't need to do that.
1662080	1665360	And if there's meetings that don't make sense, just like you did tonight, which was great.
1666080	1667840	Just say, no, it's okay.
1667840	1669360	You know, we'll figure it out.
1670000	1670880	And I do that too.
1670880	1676000	And I try to be a lot more purposeful now because it helps me then be more present
1676000	1677600	in the meetings that I need to be in.
1677600	1678000	Yeah.
1678000	1678720	Right.
1678720	1682400	And rather than saying, it's not the quantity of meetings that I'm in,
1682400	1684720	it's those quality of meeting moments that I'm in.
1685280	1692320	And I think people sometimes like misinterpret like quantity for productivity versus like value.
1692960	1698160	And I'm much more like, okay, I'm going to do, I'm going to focus on quality.
1698160	1699120	And it may mean less.
1699760	1702240	And that doesn't have to sacrifice my impact.
1702240	1704720	I was going to ask you, how does it impact productivity?
1705440	1709280	And I do think that we've convinced ourselves that if I'm doing more,
1709280	1713440	if there's more on my schedule, if I'm jumping around, we've created
1714240	1719520	our definition of value to be around busyness, right?
1719520	1720320	Yes.
1720320	1724800	And we all feel we're more important, valuable, and it's subconscious.
1724800	1728720	Again, you just think, oh yeah, if I've got a lot to do, then I must be doing something.
1728720	1729280	Yeah.
1729280	1731360	How do we start to shift that conversation?
1731360	1732800	What have you learned about that?
1732800	1736240	I know you interviewed some amazing people as well, as you were saying inside the book.
1736240	1740080	What did you learn about how we can reframe what we believe makes us valuable?
1740080	1740880	Yeah, yeah.
1740880	1747360	So I had, so two people in particular, so John Scully, for example, the former CEO of Apple,
1748320	1752000	he talked about how in the book he was chief listening officer.
1752640	1754160	And I was like, really?
1754160	1754880	And he's like, yeah.
1755600	1758800	Like Steve asked that we make our own business cards.
1759760	1761680	And I wrote chief listening officer.
1762320	1765680	And I sat there and I was like, wow, that's, that was great.
1766400	1767600	You listen.
1767600	1772000	And so, because so often, you know, you just start talking.
1772720	1779760	And he's like, no, I became a lot more purposeful if I just listened first, said probably less.
1780720	1784960	But that impact was greater because I heard what was happening and I thought that was great.
1785840	1789920	I had Jack Rowe, who's a former CEO of Aetna in the book, he came over and he said,
1791200	1793280	sometimes you have to put yourself into neutral.
1793920	1797760	And he's like, and you have to give yourself space because you can't run at 100 miles an hour.
1798320	1803280	And if you don't give yourself a little bit of a break, no matter what position you're in,
1804240	1809680	you're going to find yourself upside down and you're not going to figure out how to turn back up.
1810640	1816720	And I appreciated those conversations with them because they're a little bit more old school in
1816720	1817360	their approach.
1818400	1821200	They think we're a little bit more in the middle now.
1821200	1824240	And then there's a younger generation, right, that's coming up with things about things completely
1824240	1829680	different. It's been such a privilege to be able to kind of talk to so many different people
1830400	1834400	who are in that continuum to kind of hear how they're managing it, right?
1835040	1837920	Even like how you think about things today and how you manage all that, right?
1837920	1841920	It just must be a lot coming at you today from many different angles when they're like,
1841920	1843040	Jay, what do you do?
1843040	1848800	Yeah, yeah. And I think for me, it is the old cliche, but it's so true.
1848800	1850640	Like you are only as good as your team.
1851360	1855040	And I do think being a leader means taking care of your team.
1855040	1856000	That's right.
1856000	1860480	In one sense, I feel like that's all a leader actually has to do is be the coach,
1860480	1865680	therapist, support system or provide and bring those things in for the team.
1865680	1867600	And you almost become a coach.
1867600	1868000	Right.
1868000	1869520	And yes, you're being strategic.
1869520	1870880	Yes, you're being a visionary.
1871440	1876000	But a lot of it is just loving people and supporting people.
1876000	1879760	I find at least, I find like that's what most of my time is taken up.
1879760	1880480	100%.
1880480	1883280	Doing because everyone has their emotions.
1883280	1885600	And as long as you have smart people that you're working with,
1886400	1890000	then those people are the people that investing in them as humans.
1890000	1890480	Yeah.
1890480	1892640	Is allowing them to do what you trust them to do.
1892640	1893200	That's right.
1893200	1897760	But the thing that's holding them back is usually something emotional or mental.
1897760	1900000	It's rarely professional that people have challenges.
1900000	1902880	And I find it's something they're going through in their personal life.
1903440	1905120	It's a mental block that they have.
1905120	1905920	Yeah.
1905920	1909280	And if that doesn't get healed and accessed in the workplace,
1910000	1911840	that's going to be the spanner in the works.
1911840	1915680	Like that's going to be the thing that bottlenecks the process,
1915680	1918640	creates inefficiency, creates a lack of trust.
1918640	1919120	That's right.
1919120	1920800	That's the kind of stuff that gets in the way.
1920800	1921200	Yeah.
1921200	1923920	And a lot of times too, when you talk to people,
1923920	1926640	they have no idea what's happening outside the workplace.
1926640	1927360	Mm-hmm.
1927360	1931760	You know, but so much that happens outside the workplace affects the workplace.
1932640	1937200	It's really important for companies too, to have mental health support tools for employees.
1937200	1940240	So when they need things, people to talk to, you know, applications,
1940240	1943360	whether they're calm or others, therapy, if they need it,
1944080	1948000	if they just make those available and known, that's another step in the process.
1948000	1948240	Yeah.
1948240	1950560	So that's why I always tell people, it's not just one thing.
1950560	1953120	It's kind of like a number of things you have to put together,
1953120	1955920	because people may take bits and pieces of each to make it their own.
1956720	1959440	But it kind of shows them when they need it, it's there.
1959440	1959760	Yeah.
1959760	1962480	And a lot of times people will go look for things on their own.
1962480	1965520	You know, they'll search and they'll see if you got tools and what companies.
1966400	1969200	And I do find that you sometimes will lose good people
1969200	1971520	because you're not supporting them in their journey.
1971520	1971920	Yeah.
1971920	1976720	And so the more you could be there for them and they know that,
1977360	1981760	they become some of your most loyal, most productive,
1981760	1985280	most culture bearing, you know, carrying the flag employees.
1985280	1985600	Yeah.
1985600	1986800	And you didn't have to tell them to do it.
1986800	1988400	They just kind of did it on their own.
1988400	1989120	Absolutely.
1989120	1991680	And I feel like those often are the best ones.
1992480	1995040	And I, and we have a lot of those.
1995840	1999120	And I'm very, and I just feel very privileged that we have so many folks like that,
1999840	2002480	that they just care deeply and it's personal for them.
2003760	2006400	My previous company I had started was a caregiving company.
2007360	2012080	And one thing I noticed in that company was that so many people that were caring for
2012080	2015040	others were suffering, right?
2015040	2020560	They, and then they had to go to work and people had no idea that they were doing like five jobs,
2021360	2023920	caregiver, they were worrying about their finances.
2023920	2026000	They were trying to figure out how they help people.
2026000	2029600	And then they had to go to work and, and they had a litany of things they had to go do.
2029600	2033120	And most people have no idea all these things are going on in their people's lives,
2033120	2033280	right?
2033280	2034800	Because sometimes we just don't ask the question.
2035360	2039280	And because we're so busy ourselves, or sometimes we don't want to ask the question
2039280	2041680	because we're so busy ourselves, we can't take anything else off.
2042320	2049040	But I just feel that if we are just more aware and we create space for employees and we listen to
2049040	2052800	what they have to say, flexible work schedules, what are they asking for?
2052800	2055200	That's why I constantly poll our employees as well.
2055840	2056800	What do you value?
2057600	2058880	And they'll tell us.
2059600	2063120	And then if we have stuff that they don't want, we put it away.
2063120	2065920	I sometimes like, oh, all my employees want this gym membership.
2066480	2067520	And then nobody uses it.
2069440	2071680	And, and they're like, just ask.
2071680	2072240	Yeah.
2072240	2077120	And I'm like, now I just ask, let's have our team go out and say, here are the top 10 things.
2077120	2077840	What do you want?
2077840	2078560	Yeah.
2078560	2081520	And then we'll take away a couple of things that they don't use, you know,
2081520	2084240	and we'll try to ask that almost every year.
2084240	2084800	Totally.
2084800	2086560	I, I, I couldn't agree more.
2086560	2088720	We, I love gift giving.
2088720	2090000	It's one of my love languages.
2090000	2093600	And you were so kind to bring me a gift today, which was very thoughtful
2093600	2097760	and very useful and both of which I will use.
2097760	2101120	And the reason I'm saying that is I love giving gifts too.
2101840	2105280	And so, you know, over the years, when it comes around the holidays,
2105280	2106960	I love getting gifts for my team.
2107760	2111440	And for a long time, I'd always be guessing like what everyone wanted.
2112160	2116000	And you assume that something's cool or trending or whatever it may be.
2116000	2119440	And then you start to realize what you just said, people didn't really want that.
2119440	2120080	Yeah.
2120080	2122320	And then at one point we were like, okay, well then we won't give gifts.
2122320	2124720	We'll just, you know, thank people and whatever else it was.
2124720	2127120	But then we were like, no, but people like, people like it.
2127120	2127280	Yeah.
2127280	2128480	Everyone enjoys it.
2128480	2129280	And so, it's so funny.
2129280	2131120	We've started polling over the last few years.
2131120	2132960	Like what kind of gift would everyone like?
2132960	2135600	And the number one answer this year was infrared masks.
2135600	2137040	Like, so what are you calling out here?
2137040	2137760	Yeah.
2137760	2139120	That was the number one request.
2139120	2139920	Yeah, that's great.
2139920	2140480	The red light.
2140480	2141040	Yeah.
2141040	2142160	So that was the number one request.
2142160	2143120	And we're like, oh, easy.
2143120	2144800	Now we know what everyone wants.
2145360	2149760	So we're going to get that because it's easier rather than us guessing.
2149760	2150160	Yeah.
2150160	2155280	And I agree that I do think people inside of organizations today want mental health tools.
2155280	2155440	That's right.
2155440	2157440	They want meditation practices.
2157440	2161680	They want mindfulness opportunities and tools and apps and everything else.
2161680	2164000	I do believe there is a big demand for that.
2164480	2166400	And I think it's only growing.
2166400	2166960	Oh, yeah.
2166960	2170400	Because people are feeling that if you don't have that,
2170960	2173200	you can't have that conversation in the workplace.
2173200	2173600	That's right.
2173600	2177280	I think this is the part that I want companies and leaders to understand.
2177280	2182000	If you're not providing tools to support people with their mental health,
2182800	2186240	they don't have a vehicle to talk about it at work.
2186240	2186720	That's right.
2186720	2189760	If it's available to everyone and they see it come out in the newsletter
2189760	2193200	and the team's available and everyone knows about it, they can say,
2193200	2194800	oh, yeah, did you see we're using Calm now?
2194800	2196720	And, you know, I've been doing this one.
2196720	2197840	And which one have you been doing?
2197840	2202320	And now it allows for connection and conversation and community,
2202320	2205280	as opposed to without it, someone may just never talk about the fact
2205280	2207200	that they've been struggling to sleep for seven days.
2207200	2207920	A hundred percent.
2207920	2208320	Right?
2208320	2208800	A hundred percent.
2208800	2212080	And I find that, too, amongst the younger generation,
2212720	2213920	they just expect these things.
2213920	2214400	Yeah.
2214400	2216160	You know, and they're asking for them.
2216160	2218240	And they'll give up other things along the way.
2218240	2218640	Yeah.
2218640	2220800	And so, and they're very vocal around it.
2221440	2223760	And we've seen it now in all industries.
2224320	2226000	You know, we've seen it happen in banking,
2226000	2228080	where people feel like, hey, you're not listening.
2228720	2233200	And it takes a moment where they have to go to the press almost.
2233200	2233600	Right?
2233600	2235200	It shouldn't have to ever get there.
2235200	2235760	Yeah.
2235760	2239920	If they were listening to those kids and listening to your employees,
2240480	2242560	then you've got a continuous feedback loop.
2242560	2243120	Yeah.
2243120	2244960	More companies, the baseline will be,
2244960	2246960	you have to have these services going forward.
2247680	2251680	And, and I think over time, then that will open up a dialogue.
2252400	2254400	And I also think with CEOs today, I'll tell you,
2254400	2256000	because it starts so much at the top.
2256960	2259120	If you start to have some of these conversations and say,
2259120	2260160	here's how I think about it.
2260160	2262000	Here's how you're being vulnerable.
2262000	2263920	That too opens up a different conversation.
2264640	2267440	And then that can just kind of percolate within the company.
2268080	2271760	And, and then I think the whole thing starts to move faster.
2272320	2272800	Right?
2272800	2275920	And then we can start to get more into a conversation of like,
2275920	2278880	okay, now how do we get you the right care at the right time
2278880	2280480	when you need it, however you need it?
2281280	2285360	Because so much of the conversation we're having right now is pretty basic in my mind.
2286000	2289120	And we just need to get farther along in the conversation.
2289120	2289440	Yeah.
2289440	2294320	I think a lot of people will question listening to us going,
2295120	2300240	well, how does mindfulness or meditation actually help burnout?
2300240	2301920	Well, how does it help stress?
2301920	2302800	So that's one thing.
2302800	2304320	And I mean, there's tons of science on that,
2304320	2307280	but I think there's still, so I want, I want you to answer that.
2307280	2311200	And the second thing is, well, how does this affect my productivity?
2311200	2311440	Right?
2311440	2315600	Like how does it actually get people to do the work that I need them to do?
2315600	2316000	Sure.
2316000	2320720	And isn't this just a distraction or slows them down?
2320720	2324640	Because I know a lot of organizations just feel like this sounds good in theory,
2324640	2325520	but how does it help?
2325520	2329600	So if we could talk about how mindfulness and meditation, specifically the programs
2329600	2333520	that exist on Calm, how do they make sense for stress and burnout?
2333520	2335920	Then how do they make sense for productivity and performance?
2335920	2336160	Yeah.
2336160	2337440	I mean, I think I have both of those.
2337440	2340640	I'll start with the second one first because it comes up a lot.
2341520	2346000	And what I often tell people is when, I'll just use Calm as an example,
2346640	2350080	more than half the people that use Calm today come to us for sleep.
2350080	2353760	And they're having moments where they just can't fall asleep.
2353760	2357520	Most of that comes, as we know, because they're sleeping next to their devices.
2357520	2359520	The devices are constantly beeping.
2359520	2360640	They don't shut them off.
2361200	2366000	I talk about like, it's hard, but you know, I keep my phone outside my bedroom.
2366000	2367520	Not everyone does that.
2367520	2368800	When I travel, I don't do that.
2369440	2374400	And sometimes it leads to, you know, not a good sleep.
2375120	2378560	And we know when you have a number of those days that start to compound,
2379280	2381200	it could lead to irritability.
2381200	2385440	It could lead to not being as productive the next day when you go to work,
2385440	2387680	because you're just tired, right?
2388240	2391920	You couple that at times with potentially bad eating habits
2392560	2396320	or some people drinking habits or other types of habits that aren't.
2396880	2400480	And that doesn't create, and it creates kind of like what I call negative behavior.
2401040	2404400	I had that when I was younger because I didn't understand some of these tools.
2405200	2408160	And I just wish I had some of these tools when I was younger,
2408160	2411680	because I didn't, I didn't do those things that created positive behavior change.
2411680	2417040	Um, when I was in banking, for example, I, and when I got stressed,
2417920	2420880	I turned to smoking and I was just a kid.
2420880	2423440	And I was like smoking in the stairwell of Solomon brothers.
2424080	2425760	I shouldn't have been smoking in the stairwell.
2425760	2426560	That's number one.
2427360	2433520	I talked about this with our employees saying, Hey, I didn't have apps like calm or tools
2433520	2434640	to help me in the moment.
2435120	2436080	I wish I did.
2436080	2441360	I probably would have turned to other things and understood that's positive behavior
2441360	2443200	that I could turn to not negative behavior.
2443840	2447120	And if I have enough of that, then it starts to kind of change the pendulum
2447120	2449840	because I then ended up on a very slippery slope.
2449840	2452560	You know, you're smoking, you start to drink a little bit more,
2452560	2454960	then I'm eating more at odd hours.
2454960	2455920	And then I try to go to sleep.
2456480	2459520	And you just know if you're trying to eat Chinese food at 1130,
2459520	2463280	and you want to go to bed at 12 or 1230, you're not going to sleep well.
2463280	2465840	Cause there's just a lot of stuff just sitting there, right?
2465840	2467120	Keeping you awake.
2467120	2470240	And so for me, it's been this continuous kind of learning.
2470960	2474960	And we talk about some of these things and, you know, I think in the workforce,
2474960	2476720	it's, it's a little, it's no different.
2477280	2479920	Cause then people got to shuttle the kids off to school in the morning
2479920	2480960	and you got to make breakfast.
2480960	2482000	You got to do all these things.
2482720	2485600	So you, you kind of need good sleep at night.
2486320	2488160	And it starts, I think a lot there.
2488160	2490640	And then during the day, we need breaks.
2491440	2497200	People think, uh, and it's in the book that you, that our brain has endless capacity.
2497760	2498800	It's just not true.
2498800	2500240	We don't have endless capacity.
2500800	2505040	You know, our brain, like everything else needs to recharge.
2505920	2510800	And if you can find ways to recharge, whether it's listening to you every day,
2511520	2514400	uh, congratulations on over 600 episodes.
2514400	2521440	We were talking about 50 million streams as our chief purpose officer, which I am so grateful for,
2521440	2527360	because there are times where those seven minutes from me, where I listen to you,
2527360	2531760	whether it's in the car, driving my kids, uh, to school takes 10 minutes.
2532320	2534240	Uh, some days it takes 30 with traffic.
2535200	2538720	There, there are moments that I just cherish or when I'm driving back alone.
2539360	2544880	And it's, it just helps me then as I start to recenter myself to be more productive during the
2544880	2550480	day or during the day, I take a short break and I know how to recharge now, whether it's going
2550480	2552080	outside, walking or others.
2552080	2558720	And it makes me so much more productive because what I find is if I work in a manner and I find
2558720	2565840	myself falling below 50%, 25% of my battery, and I just keep trying to power through my work gets,
2566400	2567200	it's not very good.
2568080	2569600	It's embarrassingly bad.
2569600	2573920	I would say at times and no amount of AI is going to make it better.
2573920	2574400	Yeah.
2574400	2575520	You know, it's just not.
2575520	2576000	Yeah.
2576000	2583360	And so I then have to kind of take a step back and be like, okay, you're trending in
2583360	2584160	the wrong direction.
2584960	2585440	Take a beat.
2586080	2590320	And I talk about this at a company and with many other companies that are out there today.
2590320	2593040	And I know so many employees I talk to resonate around this.
2593040	2593520	Yeah.
2593520	2593760	Right.
2593760	2595680	Cause they just feel it's an endless hamster wheel.
2595680	2596240	For sure.
2596240	2596560	Right.
2596560	2596880	Sure.
2596880	2597120	Yeah.
2597120	2603040	I was, as you were speaking, I was thinking about how if you have a still mind, you actually
2603040	2611040	make quicker, better decisions. And if you have a stressed mind, you actually make slower,
2611600	2612480	worse decisions.
2612480	2613200	Yeah.
2613200	2617920	And we think, oh, well, if I take time out to be still, I'll lose time. But actually,
2617920	2620240	if you take time out to be still, you'll gain time.
2620240	2620640	Yeah.
2620640	2626480	Because you'll make better decisions. They'll be more long-term. They won't be rushed and haphazard.
2626480	2631600	And they'll actually be, you'll be a better communicator. I know for a fact that if I'm stressed,
2631600	2633680	I don't communicate as clearly. Yeah.
2633680	2639200	I can, I can be a bit more like rushed and, you know, kind of like, let's hurry this up and short.
2639200	2639920	Short with people.
2639920	2646240	Yeah. Whereas if I'm rested and I'm still, then actually I'm able to formulate ideas.
2646240	2650560	I can be more tolerant. I can be more patient, which are all the skills you need. And so
2651120	2657200	taking out seven minutes a day doesn't make you slower. It actually makes you faster and better.
2657200	2661440	And, and something I pulled from your book, these, these stats were really fascinating for me to
2661440	2668080	read. So 61% of people feel expected to just get over stress.
2668080	2668480	Yeah.
2669600	2669920	Yeah.
2669920	2677520	That's unbelievable that 61% of people feel like they're expected to just get over stress.
2677520	2677840	Yeah.
2677840	2686240	It's just, why is that when I was younger and I didn't understand this, uh, when I was 14 years
2686240	2690160	old and I think it was much younger. I wrote about it in the book that it was 14. I actually think it
2690160	2696240	happened when I was younger. I just didn't, I just don't recollect those times when I got really
2696240	2701840	stressed or nervous. And most of the time they're around like tests or speaking stuff or in front of
2701840	2708080	the class, I just started to get a tightness in my chest. I would, I would get shortness of breath
2708080	2712880	at times. I would sweat in my hands and I didn't really understand what was happening. And I talked
2712880	2719040	to my mom, you know, and like a very traditional Korean mother, she'd be like, just power through it.
2719040	2722640	And I'm like, okay, I'm just going to power through it. Right. But she didn't know either
2722640	2726880	what was happening. And I don't blame her around that. She just didn't understand in the moment.
2726880	2732480	You know, the reality is when you think about your mental health, it's not about just do,
2732480	2737200	you know, and it's not about powering through the moment. It's for me, it's about powering up,
2738000	2741360	you know, and it's, and that's where the battery analogy keeps coming back in.
2741360	2746480	Yeah. And, and I didn't understand some of that. And then you cup, and then I didn't have the
2746480	2751200	vocabulary. It wasn't really until I started getting into healthcare that I started to understand,
2751200	2756560	oh, wow, this is what you were going through. You've been able to kind of manage it and through
2756880	2761280	some unhealthy behaviors at times. And now you are doing it through healthy behaviors,
2762480	2767040	but the vocabulary has changed. Right. And you have a better command of that vocabulary. So you
2767040	2769680	know how to talk about it now where I didn't know how to talk about it then.
2769680	2776000	Yeah. And so I do think so much of the, the population today is about powering through it.
2776000	2782160	And I do think a lot of the population, and I would say more in countries like Korea or Asia,
2783040	2787360	even though mental health is the most approachable it's ever been, like in the States,
2788800	2794560	it's not really approachable there, you know, and, and that does make me sad at times when I go back
2794560	2798480	home, my parents moved back to Korea, they live there. I want to talk about these things with them.
2798480	2803840	And it's just not, it's not easy for them to talk about. Right. I don't know how it was for you.
2803840	2805920	Yeah, I know. Did you talk about this when you were a kid with you?
2805920	2809280	It's so interesting what you were saying about your experiences of stress growing up,
2809280	2813760	mine were the same and they didn't know what it was either. So I would, it's the same things,
2813760	2820480	exams, anything high performance related. I'd feel like my chest got tighter. My heart felt like it
2820480	2826320	wasn't being the same. I'd get, you know, sweaty palms. And I remember going to the doctors and
2826320	2832240	they'd wire me up with these monitors, like old school monitors, big things. I'd have to wear it for
2832240	2837600	24 hours. And I'd go back and they'd be like, oh, he's fine. And I'd be like, but mom, I'm not fine.
2837600	2842240	Like there's something I'm feeling and there was no word for it. And so I can very much relate.
2842240	2845680	And again, my mom didn't know what it was either. And she was trying her best to help,
2845680	2851200	but we couldn't figure it out. And so I got on with it and I always have. And then I was thankful
2851200	2857120	enough to learn mindfulness and meditation many years later that have been my core practices.
2857120	2861920	And now it's not that I don't get nervous before I'm going on stage or a podcast.
2862560	2867520	I still do, but I know what to do. And so I have my breath work. I know what I have to lock into.
2867520	2873120	It's not that I don't experience those emotions anymore, but I agree even in a South Asian family,
2873120	2880480	like I don't think that vulnerability was normal from parents. It wasn't common for uncles and aunts
2880480	2885520	to be that way. And so it created a culture of always putting your best foot forward,
2886160	2889120	always somewhat being performative.
2889120	2889680	That's right.
2889680	2894240	And I think I never subscribed to that. So I started very early on rebelling and just
2894240	2894800	Good for you.
2894800	2895760	Being myself.
2895760	2898240	I wish I had done that.
2898240	2902960	Yeah. And I was just, I'm just, I started breaking the rules early on that and I'm grateful that I
2902960	2909120	did. But now I realize it wasn't that I was breaking the rules. I was just expressing my
2909120	2916160	discomfort with having to put up a face or a mask on when everything wasn't okay.
2916160	2916880	Yeah.
2916880	2923280	And, and I think that's hard for people to do today, where I read another stat that said 33%
2923280	2927520	of people feel too overwhelmed by daily stress to think ahead.
2927520	2928080	Yeah.
2928080	2933040	Like when you think about that, it's like, gosh, like, you know, that's what people are under.
2933040	2933520	Mm-hmm.
2933520	2934400	What are some of the-
2934400	2935520	I mean, you forget that, right?
2935520	2936240	You forget that.
2936240	2942320	You just forget it. I mean, you think about those numbers, that's whether it's two thirds or one third
2942880	2948320	of all people feeling this way. And you start to realize, well, that's heavy, you know? And
2948320	2952320	if you were in a room and three out of 10 or six out of 10 are feeling a certain way,
2952320	2957120	you start to realize there's more. This is why with corporations, I think it's so important
2957120	2958800	that they can take leadership positions.
2958800	2959840	Mm-hmm.
2959840	2962640	Again, I always go back to the top on some of these things, because
2963520	2969120	if we're not comfortable being vulnerable, and if we're not comfortable making sure that our
2969120	2974400	HR teams have the tools to talk about this with employees, that we don't support some of these
2974400	2980320	initiatives, we're kind of in a place where we're saying, oh, we don't believe some of those stats,
2980320	2981600	but the stats are there and growing.
2981600	2982240	Mm-hmm.
2982240	2987040	Right? And, and yes, there's, you know, there's life things that are happening,
2987040	2989520	but technology is moving so fast on the other side.
2989520	2990000	Mm-hmm.
2990000	2994560	Right? I mean, we are definitely in an era right now where kids have grown up with their
2994560	3000240	smartphones. They act differently than, you know, when I grew up or when you grew up. It's just
3000240	3004320	different. We, and they grew up with this technology. They're very comfortable with it,
3004320	3009280	the speed of it, which is coming. And so, and then there's the weight of what's happening just
3009280	3015360	in life around them. And so some of these things, even at the company level, which are interesting,
3015360	3019440	and you don't do this is like, and I found this a little bit with myself. I'll just tell you on a
3019440	3025600	personal front, we're taught to play it very safe. And I think that's an important thing,
3025600	3030640	too. I'll tell you a lot of people miss is that, you know, you don't want to say the wrong thing.
3030640	3034080	So you're not going to talk about your own vulnerability because that's not playing it
3034080	3038960	down the fairway. You kind of want to be boring. I'll be frank with you for a lot of leaders,
3038960	3043680	not all leaders, which we know there's a couple of them that are quite, but for most leaders,
3043680	3048880	when you go out there, they're media trained to be right down the fairway.
3048880	3055600	And what I love when I listen and watch your podcast, it's so authentic. It's so real.
3056160	3062800	It's so safe for all the people that listen. And then, and it just shows right with how many people
3062800	3067440	are tuning in every day. Right. And listening to you and doing what I did. It's like, I'll listen
3067440	3070640	to somebody and then I'll go back to that. I'll be like, Oh, I remembered that I'm going to go back
3070640	3076720	to that. And it's just because we just play it safe in a lot of places today. And you don't want
3076720	3081280	to say the wrong thing. Yeah. And I think it's okay. You know, like even if I was here with you
3081280	3087040	today and maybe something, and I didn't say the right thing today, I'm in a space where I feel so
3087040	3090960	safe with you right now. I just want to be myself and not everything's going to be perfect.
3090960	3095600	Absolutely. Right. And, and that's kind of part of life. And I've started to accept that.
3096160	3101360	And I've become much more vulnerable with my own employees to be like, Hey, this is okay.
3102080	3107200	And because of that, in the last couple of years, we're stronger, we're stronger as a company.
3107920	3112160	We just had a board meeting and they're like, wow, this is great. Everyone's like, yes,
3112160	3116960	we're doing much better. But I think because we're developing and, and really building on the right
3116960	3121760	culture, we're asking the right questions or, and we want to lead by example. Yeah. Right.
3121760	3127200	What was something you shared with them that you feel was challenging, uncomfortable that,
3127200	3132160	that led to that breakthrough? Yeah. I, um, in the last one that you were at,
3132160	3139360	I did talk about my smoking as a kid. I talked about me being overweight as a child, dealing with
3139360	3147840	that, that insecurity. Um, I've always had a struggle with food. I love French fries. I'm just gonna,
3148560	3154960	yeah, I guess I'm telling you, I love ice cream. And I think sometimes, and I have a really,
3154960	3162080	no matter what I try to do diet wise, I, if you put some fries in front of me, I'm gonna eat them.
3164240	3168560	Uh, if I, if you put some ice cream in front of me and someone, my kids are having, I'm gonna eat
3168560	3172640	some of that too. And my kids are like, dad, I thought you're like full. I was like, I was.
3173760	3178720	All right. So I struggle with that. I know when I'm a little bit stressed, I'm a little bit of a binge
3178720	3184960	eater as well. I try to obviously develop a lot of healthy habits also around how to be healthier.
3184960	3190960	And so I do, I do exercise a lot more, but some of those things are hard just to get rid of,
3190960	3195520	you know, it's, it's more like you're going to have to live with it and it's how you live with it.
3195520	3199040	That's like that comment about stress. You're never going to have a stress-free workplace,
3199040	3202880	but you got to figure out how you just have more healthy stress,
3202880	3207280	right. How you stress rather than distress. Yeah. What's, what's the most common thing
3207280	3211760	you hear from leaders that they're struggling with in their organizations when it comes to
3212480	3218240	stress and teams, mental health. I, I think a lot of leaders today struggle with,
3218880	3223520	as I spoke to you about vulnerability and how you gave the story about vulnerability,
3224080	3227120	that story plays over, over and over again. Wow.
3227120	3232240	You know, leaders struggle with how to be vulnerable. And I think it's, I think it's
3232880	3236320	generational on a personal, I think the new leaders that are going to rise,
3236320	3241600	the ones in their twenties are going to have no problem. All right. Because when you look at social
3241600	3246080	media today and a lot of the younger generation, they talk about their mental stress and they talk
3246080	3252800	about their mental health and they're very open about it. Now, again, they may overuse it or, you know,
3252800	3258240	but at least they're having a conversation around it. I think, you know, with other leaders today,
3258240	3262640	when I talk to them, they're just like, Hey, is it a sign of weakness? Like you brought up
3263520	3267440	in, is it going to be used against me? Yeah. Is someone going to write about it and say,
3267440	3274560	I'm too weak. Is the board going to think I'm weak as a leader? And I think that is the,
3274560	3280480	that's ultimately also a fail of corporate stewardship because they have to also look after
3280480	3285280	your mental health, you know? And so when I'm, you know, I'm fortunate to be on the board of calm
3285280	3293200	today, but if I wasn't CEO, I would be asking that CEO, Hey, how are you doing? How are you holding
3293200	3298400	up? Let's not talk about the numbers today. You know, I find it really effective when I meet with
3298400	3304400	CEOs and they ask for some coaching. We don't talk about any numbers. We don't talk about the metrics.
3305040	3311680	We just talk about life and we'll eventually go to that later. But I think when we start with more
3311680	3316880	of a trusting place where we can understand what's happening around you, then I can be much more
3316880	3322560	thoughtful in the type of advice I give. But this also means I have to create the space and the time
3322560	3327280	to do it. So not everyone has that. Right. And that's where I think it's just really important to
3327280	3332000	be really intentional. Yeah. Right. Be really purposeful in these conversations. Yeah. I think one of the
3332000	3338000	reasons why we struggle to recharge is because when your phone's running out of battery,
3338000	3342960	there's only one, well, we're also bad at this. There's only meant to be one type of charger.
3342960	3349600	Now I've seen people charge their phone with their Mac charger, destroying your phone. Right. You'd see
3349600	3355440	it being charged with the iPad charger. Like, but the point is there's one charger. Yeah. And I think
3355440	3366080	when it comes to life, sleep is a charger. Meditation and mindfulness. 100%. Food is a charger. Working
3366080	3372560	out is a charger. And people you love being around good relationships are a charger. And if everyone,
3372560	3379440	while you're listening to this, if you could figure out the most common times you feel at 1%, 5%,
3379440	3385520	10%, 20%, and figure out what's the charge you need for that. Well said. Right. Like, that's what
3385520	3390880	I think we need to do. Like, I'll give an example. I went to an event the other day and I had to fly
3390880	3396720	out of town and come back into town. I got back at like 4 a.m. And I worked out the next day and I felt
3396720	3403680	so weak because I hadn't slept well. Of course. And I had eaten well. And so at that point, I'm glad I still
3403680	3408560	worked out because I needed it. But I told my trainer I had to get a bit of an easier workout because I
3408560	3415360	didn't want to push myself when I felt weak. But it's like, it takes little adjustments of figuring
3415360	3420240	out what charge you need right now. Like now, I've had a busy week, had a busy weekend. This weekend,
3420240	3426240	I know recharge means I need no social plans. Like, that's what's going to recharge me. And so I wish
3426240	3430160	everyone could just write down while you're listening to this and while you're reading David's book,
3430160	3435520	Recharge, you write down what are those most common experiences you feel when you feel drained,
3435520	3440720	when you feel overwhelmed, when you feel burnt out and what is your charger so that you don't have
3440720	3443520	to think about it in the moment. Because when you're trying to figure it out in the moment,
3444080	3449280	that's when you get more overwhelmed. Like I know before I go on stage, I always practice breath work.
3449280	3454640	If I've had a couple of late nights, I know sleep is the only charge that's going to solve it.
3454640	3459360	Yeah. Speaking of that, because you've talked about certain rituals. Are there
3459360	3464240	certain things that you do every day, like religion every day that you just do?
3464240	3470160	Yeah, I kind of do what I call like, what I feel is like a good 80-20. So like, I know five days
3470160	3477360	out of the seven days a week, I'm working out. Five days out of seven, I'm meditating before 9am.
3478000	3483120	And then the other two will be meditating after 9am. And I like that balance that I have.
3483840	3486320	Gratitude is something I'm practicing every single day.
3486320	3491840	Yeah, it's such an important one. I think we do something with my team that I love. Every
3492400	3497440	Friday, we'll do a weekly win. And everyone's encouraged to share what they believe is their
3497440	3503520	win. And sometimes what's amazing about this activity is you feel it will always be like,
3503520	3509920	oh, we had so-and-so on the podcast, or we won so-and-so award or, and it isn't. It's actually
3509920	3515680	these little things that people are doing behind the scenes that are not like these grand wins
3515680	3520720	externally. And they believe that that's been their success. And I think it's a really great
3520720	3525200	way to actually get to know each other because you get to see what people value as success.
3525200	3525920	Yeah, 100%.
3525920	3530800	And you get to understand what people see as value in the work they do. Whereas we just assume that,
3530800	3534560	of course, if there's a big quarter, then everyone should be excited. And it's like,
3534560	3535440	well, maybe not.
3535440	3535840	Right.
3535840	3541360	Because that's not what they equate as their personal success and contribution. And so
3541360	3544640	doing the weekly wins on Friday is one of my favorite things to do with my team.
3544640	3545200	I love that.
3545200	3546800	It takes like 30 minutes to do.
3546800	3547360	Yeah.
3547360	3550960	And everyone just goes around my core team and just shares what was their weekly win.
3550960	3551120	Yeah.
3551120	3551600	It's huge.
3551600	3556320	I love that. I sometimes start my beginning of the week staff meetings with like, how was your
3556320	3561680	weekend? Just tell us something that happened personal. You know, I also find sometimes we get into
3561680	3565840	all the details without getting to know one another. Yeah. You know, and I find a lot,
3566880	3571280	a lot of times teams don't work well. They can work better together when they're a little bit
3571280	3575120	more personal with one another. And it may, it doesn't have to be deep. It could just be like,
3575120	3579600	hey, what did you do? Some people will say, I went on a hike. I, you know, went to my kid's game
3579600	3584960	or, you know, I went, I traveled somewhere or binge watched a show and we're all like, what show?
3584960	3588560	What's your favorite show or something? And we just get to learn something a little bit more
3588560	3594960	personal about the individual. And then it's less about, oh, did you hand in that PRD or something?
3594960	3597200	Right. It's just, it's more personal. Yeah.
3597200	3602800	And I think, and by you just doing your wins every week, you know, how I just, I love that.
3602800	3608000	Yeah. I think about it as very simple. I think about it like this, like you're going to spend
3608000	3609920	a third of your life at work. Yeah.
3610640	3612880	Learn to get along with your colleagues. Yeah.
3612880	3618160	Learn to build relationships with the people you spend nine hours a day with.
3618160	3622960	You're going to spend a third of your life with these people. You should actually really get
3622960	3627520	to know them. You should be able to laugh with them. It would be wonderful if you could open your
3627520	3632960	heart with them. When we kind of go, well, work's this thing over here and I save all of that for
3632960	3639360	home. You're basically saying that 30% of your life, you'll never experience joy. You'll never
3639360	3644080	experience connection. And I don't think that's the world we want anymore. I think we need a world
3644080	3648240	where work can be meaningful and thoughtful and purposeful. And again, going back to what you
3648240	3651200	said, it's not that it will ever be stress free. That's right.
3651200	3655920	It's not that it's ever going to be perfect or this utopia or this beautiful place where
3655920	3661280	everything's amazing. But I think one of the things we don't realize is that a lack of productivity
3661280	3663360	stems from a lack of trust. Yeah.
3663360	3668960	When you have trust and you have interpersonal connection, things move faster. People are not
3668960	3674720	gatekeeping. No one's trying to be a bottleneck. No one's looking out for how they can be top dog.
3674720	3677360	There's this feeling of we're all going to win together. And I think
3678080	3684400	if leaders can start to figure out what that culture is, then people will achieve so much more
3684400	3689840	and they'll be happier. I think, you know, one of my, I would hate to be at the top of a hill with the
3689840	3694720	team and three people like gave up along the way. Two people told me they never want to come back.
3694720	3695440	That's right.
3695440	3700400	It's in it. I was, I was going to ask you, you've had so much business success before Calm, you're
3700400	3706400	now at Calm. Like walk us through how your views have changed of recharging and recharging your team.
3706400	3710160	It's, it's, it's actually really interesting. I used to be one of the youngest execs in the room,
3710160	3715840	and now I'm the oldest person in the room. I think when I was younger,
3715840	3723120	I felt that I had to be in every decision process. And that's a little bit of like,
3723120	3728320	oh, I'm productive because I got my hands in everything. And it was probably the opposite.
3728320	3733280	I was probably causing more stress and less productivity on a person. And I realized that
3733280	3740160	later that it's, it's not the number of meetings or decisions you're making. It's not the quantity.
3740160	3744240	It's the quality of those decisions. And I keep going back always the quality of decision making.
3744240	3746800	What is a quality decision? Let's, let's define that.
3746800	3747920	Yeah, that's great. Yeah.
3747920	3753360	So like it's, it's things that you feel that where you sit could move the, for me,
3753360	3757840	could move the business forward in the most meaningful manner. So sometimes it could be
3757840	3762720	helping teams unlock a product decision. Sometimes it could be helping teams with
3763360	3768560	things that partnerships that may move it forward. Other times it may mean things around culture or HR,
3769200	3773040	but it's really being intentional in terms of the types of decisions you're making and where
3773040	3778480	you're spending your time. It's not being in every decision with everybody because ultimately
3779040	3785360	they have to make decisions too. One thing we've been doing now that I feel that has really brought
3785360	3791280	the company closer together is, uh, we did this retreat where it wasn't just a leadership team.
3791280	3796320	We brought many different people together. And I said, you guys come up with the company strategy.
3796320	3802960	And they were like, and this woman, uh, they were like, what? And I'm like, they're like, don't you
3802960	3809440	have it? My younger self would have been like, here it is. I was like, no, you do it. And I'll tell
3809440	3816880	you, it was so much better than what I was thinking. And it just reminded me again, you hire all these
3816880	3822800	smart people. You take all these time vetting them, doing reference checks, let them do their job.
3822800	3829040	Give them a chance. If it was a sports analogy to shoot the ball, give them a chance to play.
3829040	3833920	You know, don't feel like you're keeping them on the bench the whole time and you have to do
3833920	3840960	everything and give them a shot. And I, I do that a lot more now. I'm much more intentional with it.
3840960	3846320	Now. It was great. We rolled it out to the company at that offsite you were at. People came away and said
3846320	3851680	it was the most inspiring offsite. And they were like, that was great. I said, I didn't do it.
3851680	3857920	They did it. It came from the team. And I think it felt so much more meaningful to them because it
3857920	3863280	came from them and it was so much more spot on. And we, and, and really what it was around was
3863840	3867920	we've talked about trying to make the world healthier and happier. We've tried, we've talked
3867920	3871680	about as a company, trying to be with you every step of the way in your mental health journey.
3872240	3876080	And this was really around how to become, how do we become the most impactful
3876880	3882160	consumer mental health company in the world? And when I sat back and said,
3882720	3888240	that's what we want to become. And the team had kind of been the one synthesizing it.
3889120	3893760	Then everyone started mobilizing against it on their own. And I, and I, and they had thought
3893760	3898640	about things that I had never even thought about because I'm just too far sometimes away from the
3898640	3906640	details. And then now I've, I've seen us accelerate and I know that motion and muscle can be repeated.
3907280	3910000	Right. And you can bring it to other companies, regardless of size.
3910560	3914320	And I think sometimes as companies get larger and I've had the fortune of starting my own company
3914320	3919520	where it's like three of us, and then it grows to 30, whatever, 300 and then to thousands.
3920160	3924640	And then I've had the fortune of joining companies later where it's thousands and it becomes hundreds of
3924640	3931760	thousands. Ultimately that culture is your bedrock, you know, whether or not how many people you stack
3931760	3936800	on top of it, what you start to set as your foundation will percolate amongst the entire company.
3937760	3942880	And if you don't do that the right way, and if you're not thought, then you may not get the results
3942880	3947440	that you're happy with. Right. And you may create more stressful environments that you just unintentionally
3947440	3953040	didn't think about. And that's where I really appreciate about when leaders come around,
3953040	3957040	they talk about being more thoughtful in their decision-making process, being more vulnerable,
3957040	3962720	being more open, really thinking about employees' mental health, but then not just talking about it,
3962720	3964960	but then really acting upon it. Totally.
3964960	3971120	And if you can do that a little bit year after year, right, you can really create a special culture.
3971120	3975920	And I think they'll do special things. Absolutely. David, it's been such a joy talking to you
3975920	3981760	today. I really enjoyed our dialogue around recharging and, you know, I'm so grateful for
3981760	3989920	the work you're doing at Calm because I remember being an analyst at Accenture and I was tasked...
3989920	3993360	I'm sure you were really good. I was okay. I was tasked with
3994000	3999200	teaching meditation in my spare time and mindfulness in my spare time at the company. And I would travel
3999200	4005280	around and I would do lunchtime sessions and after work sessions and I couldn't scale myself.
4005280	4011360	But now thanks to Calm, not only am I able to scale myself to more people, but we're able to
4011360	4017280	introduce people to so many amazing hosts and narrators that we have on Calm. And I think inside
4017280	4022640	an organization, you no longer need someone running around the organization physically,
4023200	4027040	trying to serve lots of people. You actually have the ability for everyone to tune in.
4027760	4033360	And we end every On Purpose episode with a final five. These questions have to be answered in one
4033360	4039760	word to one sentence maximum. So David Koh, these are your final five. The first question is,
4039760	4044000	what is the best recharge advice you've ever heard in your life?
4044000	4053440	To be more present. I recognize at times that I've been there, but not really. And so you are,
4053440	4058560	you do so good at this where you're just so present, whether it's one person or hundreds or thousands,
4058560	4063600	I've seen it. I've been in your auditoriums where you've traveled and everyone feels your presence.
4064240	4064960	And so presence.
4064960	4070400	I like that answer. Not the part about me, you're very kind, but the, uh, because I don't think we
4070400	4075440	realize how draining it is when you're not present. And you gave that great analogy earlier, when you
4075440	4081760	have lots of tabs and apps open, that's when we drain our battery. And so so many of us are draining our
4081760	4085520	battery by thinking, oh, I'm here right now with David, but actually if my mind's over there,
4085520	4089600	I'll get more done. And you're actually depleting your battery. So it's a great answer.
4089600	4095360	Uh, second question. What is the worst advice you've ever heard about recharging yourself?
4097280	4102480	Sorry, mom. Cause she's going to be listening and watching. Uh, and my mom, I love my mom. So
4102480	4106640	I'm going to start by that. And she's giving me lots of great advice, but this probably was the
4106640	4112400	worst advice she gave me as a child, which was to power through. And it's not about powering through.
4112400	4118160	It's really about powering up and she didn't know, you know, but you know, mom, I think it was not
4118160	4122800	about powering through. Question number three, what's your three favorite ways to power up?
4123520	4130400	So I have rituals like you and my rituals in the morning. Uh, when I wake up, I don't look at my
4130400	4138080	phone right away. I actually go downstairs. I start the coffee. I open the window and, uh, I walk
4138080	4143440	outside and I take three breaths. And it's been something I've been very intentional about doing.
4143440	4147520	If I'm traveling, I try to open the window, you know, wherever it may be, if you're an apartment or
4147520	4156080	something, that process starts to center me. The second I do is I do a lot of walking meetings.
4156080	4161600	And so I'm a big fan of like trying to break things up that helped me reach her. So people
4161600	4167440	give me energy. I would say going outside, breathing people give me energy. And then lastly,
4167440	4173280	I think similar to yourself, I love to exercise as well. And I've become a lot better at keeping a
4173280	4177760	steady schedule around it. And even someone said this to me the other day, they said, do something
4177760	4183520	every day. Right. And, and I'm like, great. I'm gonna do something every day. And I'm gonna be
4183520	4188640	really intentional about it and just keep at it. Uh, some days I'll go to the gym. Sometimes I'll do
4188640	4193680	something at home. It'd be really quick. Um, but exercise as well. I love that. Question number four,
4193680	4200400	what are your three favorite ways to power down? I turn everything off, meaning the following.
4200960	4205600	So it won't be just putting my phone and turning it over. Cause I don't think sometimes that's enough.
4206320	4212080	I'll just be like, you know what? I'm kind of done. I wanted to ask you earlier, because I'm curious
4213520	4218880	if you had a day and you didn't use your phone, social media, what does that day look like for you?
4218880	4225040	Those are the best days. It doesn't happen very often. I've definitely tried really hard. One
4225040	4228720	thing I've really focused on is when me and my wife are together in the evening for dinner. And
4228720	4233280	then if we are watching a show or something is not bringing the phone to those two things,
4233280	4237360	because I found myself a lot of the time, like finishing off last emails, messaging while we're
4237360	4242000	having dinner. And then when you're watching a show, you're distracted. And then you watch your
4242000	4247440	partner get distracted. And then you're like mad at them for getting distracted. But then when they
4247440	4250480	put their phone down, you've got yours up and they're mad at you for getting distracted. And
4250480	4255120	I was like, what are we doing here? And I was starting to notice just my attention span just
4255760	4262320	dropping. I've noticed that a lot in the last 12 months, more than any time before. And I've
4262320	4267200	realized so much of it is because of just the speed of consumption. So now it's not even that we're
4267200	4273680	consuming a lot. We're consuming a lot at a really fast rate. And so you're just making it easier for
4273680	4280800	your mind to get two seconds of everything. And so for me, I try and make my weekends very phone
4280800	4286960	free because weekdays I am on my phone. I've also found that even when I'm with my team, if I can
4286960	4291920	have my laptop in the room, but my laptop's not connected to messaging apps, and then my phone's
4291920	4296960	not in the room, I actually find I'm better with my team. So I can still do email. I can still do work
4296960	4302400	on my laptop, but it's not wired up to WhatsApp. It's not wired up to text message. I don't need
4302400	4307520	it. And so I've been trying to leave my phone actually out of my hand when I'm not traveling.
4307520	4313040	If I'm going out for work or driving, of course I need my phone. But if I'm in the office, I don't
4313040	4318960	need my phone on me in meetings or in between meetings actually. And all of this is stuff I'm
4318960	4323600	still working on too, because I find myself go through ups and downs with it. There are times when
4323600	4328000	I'm brilliant at it. I also follow you. I don't keep my phone in my bedroom. Don't look at it
4328000	4332880	first thing in the morning. But I also have days where I break that completely when I'm traveling.
4332880	4338640	And so I don't want to make anyone feel like I've got it down or perfect because I haven't.
4338640	4342960	And I think it's almost like peaks and troughs. There's always a good day and a bad week and
4342960	4345600	a good week and a bad day. Yeah. Yeah. That's great. That's brilliant.
4345600	4346880	I love that. Just being honest. Yeah.
4347760	4352720	Fifth and final question to David Coe. If you could create one law that everyone in the world had to
4352720	4358720	follow, what would it be? Kids have to go to gym five days and they know there's physical exercise.
4358720	4364400	And it's just kind of like, it's just understood. Why can't we take some of that time for children
4364400	4369200	to also better understand their own mental health and to teach them about their mental health?
4369200	4373280	Because we know so much of this starts early, just like it started with myself at 14.
4373280	4379360	If I had that vocabulary at 14, I probably would have developed better kind of healthy behaviors at 14
4379360	4384960	and did that as I turned into a young adult. So I would love to take a little bit of time.
4384960	4389120	It doesn't have to be all the time. It could be carve outs, maybe once, twice, three times a week,
4389840	4394960	where we educate our children and check up on them on their mental health or their battery and ask
4394960	4399200	them the question. I love that. What a great law. That would have a big impact on the world.
4399200	4404880	The book is called Recharge. We've got interviews with everyone from Randall Park to Macklemore.
4404880	4410400	It's a brilliant book. So fascinating. I love the format. I love the format. The format's
4410400	4416720	fantastic. Like you sat down with experts, with rappers, with rebels, innovators, thought leaders,
4416720	4421040	and you put together this beautiful book called Recharge. David, I'm so grateful that you put it
4421040	4424880	together. I'm so grateful we connected. Yeah. And thank you for taking the time,
4424880	4430720	having me here. Thank you for talking about the book. It's something I'm so proud of. I hope
4430720	4435200	people, people get some, you know, really get something out of it. We talked to a lot of
4435200	4440640	different folks, like you said, uh, like Randall, who's, you know, you know as well, and many other
4440640	4447760	folks there, uh, Delilah, and they just talked about so many amazing things. And I, um, I was really
4447760	4452960	touched by talking to each and every one of them. I was honored to hear their stories and it just made
4452960	4457360	me a better person. It also has helped me in my mental health journey, and I hope it helps some other
4457360	4460960	people as well. David, thank you so much. Is there anything I didn't ask you that you really
4460960	4465040	want to touch on something that's on your heart or mind that's calling for you to share? I'd love
4465040	4471200	for you to share it. You never asked me how my battery is. How's your battery? I would tell you
4471200	4475760	my battery is at a hundred, over a hundred percent, because I got to spend time with you.
4475760	4482800	Oh, you're too kind. No, no. And I'll tell you, conversations like this just recharge and energize me.
4483440	4487840	I love the fact that we got to sit. I love the fact that I got to know you personally and
4487840	4493520	professionally. I'm so grateful for our friendship, your mentorship, your words of wisdom. I know how
4493520	4499600	many millions of people you affect every day. I mean, over 50 million people, the entire employee
4499600	4507200	base of calm, uh, really just, uh, I can't tell you the impact you've made both, uh, on us on a
4507200	4510640	personal and professional front. So thank you. I want to ask you, how's your battery?
4510640	4514800	Do you know what? And I'm not just saying this because you're here and I, and I really do mean
4514800	4520880	it. You've recharged my battery too. Like this conversation is, I'd say before you came in today,
4521600	4523280	I was probably at like a 60. Yeah.
4523280	4527440	Yeah. I've had a lot of social events in the past couple of weeks. Just we had Diwali,
4527440	4533040	which is our beautiful festival every year. We had, there was just so much going on and all good
4533040	4535040	stuff, all stuff I wanted to go to. Yeah.
4535040	4541360	Yeah. But I'm very disciplined about my sleep all year round. And at this time of year, I kind of let
4541360	4546560	go a little bit because there are so many wonderful events that I get invited to. And so I've been
4546560	4553280	feeling a bit, and as soon as you came in, you took me from a 60 to a 95 easily. And honestly,
4553280	4558560	it's this conversation because it felt so real, so authentic, so genuine. I felt like, again, you were
4558560	4562720	really present. And I think that's what we don't realize when you're present with someone, you're charging
4562720	4570080	them up while you're being charged. And that's such a superpower that often we think, oh, if I'm
4570080	4575360	charging someone else off, I'm losing energy. But that's not true. If you're charging someone else
4575360	4581040	up by being present, you're getting charged up and so are they. And we've both felt that today.
4581040	4588240	And I genuinely felt that today. And honestly, Calm has just been such a brilliant partner. It's the
4588240	4593040	team I love working with every day, whether it's the content team, the team that we work with in
4593040	4599200	the studio, the team that I get to see once a year, the leadership. Everyone walks the talk there.
4599200	4604960	And it's so impressive to me. Thank you. Because I felt it from the moment I started doing Zooms and
4604960	4609680	meetings with everyone at Calm. And it's remarkable what you're all doing. And I can't wait to be a part
4609680	4614880	of the future. So congratulations. And it's just the beginning. I think we're just getting started.
4614880	4618160	I appreciate it. Thank you, Jay. Thank you, David. Thanks for having me on again. Thank you so much.
4618800	4624320	If this year you're trying to live longer, live happier, live healthier, go and check out my
4624320	4631040	conversation with the world's biggest longevity doctor, Peter Attia, on how to slow down aging and
4631040	4635760	why your emotional health is directly impacting your physical health.
4635760	4641520	Acknowledge that there is surprisingly little known about the relationship between nutrition
4641520	4645120	and health. And people are going to be shocked to hear that because I think most people think the
4645120	4654880	exact opposite.
4654880	4656880	You
