00:00.160 --> 00:05.640
61% of people feel expected to just get over stress.

00:05.640 --> 00:07.800
Yeah, it's like just power through the moment.

00:07.800 --> 00:11.640
CEO of Calm, author of Recharge, David Code.

00:11.640 --> 00:13.720
Good stress could lead to resilience.

00:13.720 --> 00:14.720
You're never really gonna have

00:14.720 --> 00:16.520
a stress-free work environment.

00:16.520 --> 00:20.640
Not everything has to be 24-7, 365,

00:20.640 --> 00:23.320
because at some point you've caused a lot of bad stress.

00:23.320 --> 00:25.760
That's a real kind of indicator for you to say,

00:25.760 --> 00:28.080
I need to really kind of take a hard stop

00:28.080 --> 00:30.080
and figure out how I recharge.

00:32.400 --> 00:34.920
The number one health and wellness podcast.

00:34.920 --> 00:35.760
Jay Shetty.

00:35.760 --> 00:36.600
Jay Shetty.

00:36.600 --> 00:38.800
The one, the only, Jay Shetty.

00:40.920 --> 00:43.320
Hey everyone, welcome back to On Purpose,

00:43.320 --> 00:46.040

00:46.040 --> 00:47.840
healthier, and more healed.

00:47.840 --> 00:50.120
Thank you so much for tuning in today.

00:50.120 --> 00:53.880
Today I'm so excited because I talked to a really good friend,

00:53.880 --> 00:58.040
someone that I respect so highly and admire so deeply.

00:58.040 --> 00:59.400
And I've had the fortune of knowing

00:59.400 --> 01:01.040
for the last couple of years,

01:01.040 --> 01:05.000
I'm talking about David Code, the CEO of Calm,

01:05.000 --> 01:08.440
the leading app for meditation and mindfulness,

01:08.440 --> 01:12.520
and a new author of his book, Recharge,

01:12.520 --> 01:15.960
that offers tips for the best mental wellness practices

01:15.960 --> 01:18.200
in today's digital world.

01:18.200 --> 01:22.920
The book has interviews with rappers, rebels, and innovators,

01:22.920 --> 01:26.680
as he travels, talking about stress, burnout,

01:26.680 --> 01:28.160
and feeling drained.

01:28.160 --> 01:30.360
If any of you are feeling stressed right now,

01:30.360 --> 01:31.880
this episode's for you.

01:31.880 --> 01:34.520
If you're feeling drained from work right now,

01:34.520 --> 01:36.120
this episode's for you.

01:36.120 --> 01:38.360
And if you need to recharge,

01:38.360 --> 01:41.600
this book and episode is for you.

01:41.600 --> 01:43.320
Please welcome to On Purpose,

01:43.320 --> 01:45.960
the CEO of Calm, David Code.

01:45.960 --> 01:47.680
David, it's great to have you here.

01:47.680 --> 01:49.160
Thank you, Jay, for having me here today.

01:49.160 --> 01:50.160
I'm so excited.

01:50.160 --> 01:52.880
I'm so excited because I really feel like,

01:52.880 --> 01:55.200
ever since we met, I felt like we hit it off.

01:55.200 --> 01:55.960
Right away.

01:55.960 --> 01:57.880
Yeah, right away, right away.

01:57.880 --> 01:59.920
And I've been fortunate enough to have you

01:59.920 --> 02:01.880
interview me so many times,

02:01.880 --> 02:06.120
so I'm glad I get to repay the favor this time round.

02:06.120 --> 02:07.240
And I wanted to ask you,

02:07.240 --> 02:09.040
just to get our blood boiling,

02:09.040 --> 02:10.240
just to start with some fun,

02:10.240 --> 02:12.240
and I wanted to ask you, David,

02:12.240 --> 02:14.720
what's something that you're not calm about?

02:14.720 --> 02:17.440
I think there's a lot of things

02:17.440 --> 02:20.160
that I'm not calm about throughout my day.

02:20.160 --> 02:22.640
I will tell you right now,

02:22.640 --> 02:27.120
I am in the throes of my oldest daughter

02:27.120 --> 02:29.080
applying to colleges.

02:29.080 --> 02:32.320
Even though I try to appear very calm in front of her

02:32.320 --> 02:34.760
and cool and collective, you know?

02:34.760 --> 02:37.880
And you don't want to be like a helicopter type of parent.

02:37.880 --> 02:39.640
There are times where I'm just like,

02:39.640 --> 02:41.800
you know, I want to get in there and say something,

02:41.800 --> 02:44.560
but I realize almost like the best thing for her

02:44.560 --> 02:46.400
is for her to go through it.

02:46.400 --> 02:48.600
And I have to kind of take a backseat.

02:48.600 --> 02:51.880
And so it's kind of going from where you take the wheel

02:51.880 --> 02:53.560
to like you're in the passenger seat

02:53.560 --> 02:54.640
and then you're in the backseat

02:54.640 --> 02:56.840
kind of peering every once in a while.

02:56.840 --> 02:58.560
But I can't help myself from like,

02:58.560 --> 03:00.200
I don't know when she first learned to drive

03:00.200 --> 03:02.640
by like saying, oh, I'm stepping on the brake

03:02.640 --> 03:03.560
here and there, right?

03:03.560 --> 03:06.080
But that's one thing right now

03:06.080 --> 03:08.080
that is probably a little stressful.

03:08.080 --> 03:09.440
Yeah, no, I can imagine.

03:09.440 --> 03:14.080
I read a study that said we process around 72 gigabytes

03:14.080 --> 03:16.400
of information per day,

03:16.400 --> 03:21.200
which the research likened to reading Tolkien's The Hobbit

03:21.200 --> 03:22.200
every single day.

03:22.200 --> 03:24.480
That's nearly 96,000 words.

03:24.480 --> 03:25.480
Right, right.

03:25.480 --> 03:27.000
And you think about that and you go,

03:27.000 --> 03:28.600
no wonder we're overwhelmed.

03:28.600 --> 03:29.920
No wonder we're burnt out.

03:29.920 --> 03:31.160
No wonder we're stressed.

03:31.160 --> 03:34.040
And you have this really brilliant analogy

03:34.040 --> 03:37.000
comparing the brain and our mind to a battery.

03:37.000 --> 03:37.520
That's right.

03:37.520 --> 03:40.200
Walk us through this because I really like this in your book,

03:40.200 --> 03:43.000
Recharge, the way you break it down and explain it.

03:43.000 --> 03:46.800
You know, the recharge came from a good friend of mine

03:46.800 --> 03:49.800
and we were talking about mental health.

03:49.800 --> 03:51.560
And I just asked her, I said, you know,

03:51.560 --> 03:53.400
how's it going with your kids?

03:53.400 --> 03:55.640
And she goes, you know, I was talking to my kids

03:55.640 --> 03:57.760
and I just said, how's your battery?

03:57.760 --> 03:59.560
And I was like, wait, what?

03:59.560 --> 04:01.880
And she goes, well, I said, how's your battery?

04:01.880 --> 04:03.280
I said, why?

04:03.280 --> 04:06.160
And she said, well, if I ask them how they're doing,

04:06.160 --> 04:08.880
I get the plane fine.

04:08.880 --> 04:11.600
And because they're kids, they're just like, I'm fine.

04:11.600 --> 04:14.520
But if I ask them, like, how's your battery?

04:14.520 --> 04:17.080
They're like, well, it's at like 50%

04:17.080 --> 04:20.000
or so you may need a snack because they're little.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.200
Or it's at 75% there.

04:22.200 --> 04:23.520
She's like, oh, you're OK.

04:23.520 --> 04:25.160
Or sometimes they're at 25%

04:25.160 --> 04:28.080
and they just need something to decompress.

04:28.080 --> 04:31.440
While we were talking about it, a light bulb just went out.

04:31.440 --> 04:33.840
And that light bulb that went on was about like,

04:34.320 --> 04:36.720
she took something that at times can be charged

04:37.280 --> 04:40.640
and she took something and really simplified in a way

04:40.640 --> 04:43.320
that I think we would all understand, regardless of age.

04:43.960 --> 04:45.920
And I asked her, I was like, can I run with that?

04:45.920 --> 04:48.280
And she was like, yeah, sure, whatever, right?

04:48.280 --> 04:50.160
And we still laugh about it, Brenda and I,

04:50.160 --> 04:51.720
because she's like, wow, you actually took it.

04:51.720 --> 04:54.160
And I was like, yeah, I used it as a theme.

04:54.160 --> 04:55.640
I talk about it.

04:55.640 --> 04:57.560
I go to clients.

04:57.560 --> 04:59.920
I go out and it just kind of resonates with people

04:59.920 --> 05:01.320
because it's simple.

05:01.320 --> 05:04.400
And it doesn't kind of draw out any emotions.

05:04.400 --> 05:05.800
It just says like, hey, how's your battery?

05:05.800 --> 05:07.120
How are you feeling?

05:07.120 --> 05:10.320
And I think that sometimes that gets lost

05:10.320 --> 05:13.800
because we try to make it bigger sometimes than it is.

05:14.360 --> 05:16.920
And it's really nice when you can kind of just simplify it

05:16.920 --> 05:18.600
and just ask you, how's your battery?

05:18.600 --> 05:19.240
How are you doing?

05:19.240 --> 05:21.000
I love the question, how's your battery,

05:21.000 --> 05:23.880
even more than how you're doing, like you said.

05:23.880 --> 05:28.360
Because I think sometimes we, I think you also mentioned

05:28.360 --> 05:30.680
that we can scale everything up to a 10.

05:30.680 --> 05:31.280
That's right.

05:31.280 --> 05:34.880
So everything can feel like it's a 10, it's the worst.

05:34.880 --> 05:37.840
Or everything can feel like, oh, it's just plain old fine.

05:37.840 --> 05:38.480
That's right.

05:38.480 --> 05:40.560
And then you don't have much to play with.

05:40.560 --> 05:42.680
Whereas when you get a number, walk us through the different

05:42.680 --> 05:44.400
breakdowns as you do in the book.

05:44.400 --> 05:44.880
Yeah.

05:44.880 --> 05:47.200
Because I think when you look at zero to a hundred,

05:48.240 --> 05:52.800
we're very good at feeling zero and maybe a hundred, right?

05:52.800 --> 05:56.880
Like if it's your kid's wedding, chances are you'll be at a hundred.

05:56.880 --> 05:59.680
If it's like your kid's birthday, like you're at a hundred.

05:59.680 --> 06:03.200
Like there's these joyful, blissful moments in life

06:03.200 --> 06:06.400
that people experience and we go, yeah, that was a hundred moment.

06:06.400 --> 06:08.640
And then we all know what a zero moment feels like.

06:08.640 --> 06:11.680
You lost a loved one who sadly passed away.

06:11.680 --> 06:14.320
You got, you know, you lost your job.

06:14.320 --> 06:16.800
Like there's these very zero moments.

06:17.360 --> 06:19.760
Walk us through how you break down the zero to a hundred.

06:19.760 --> 06:21.760
Yeah. And I tried to do it really simply.

06:21.760 --> 06:25.200
You know, I have found, and I'll talk about my own kids at times.

06:25.920 --> 06:28.640
When I asked them that question, how their battery is,

06:29.440 --> 06:32.720
I noticed that they check, like most people,

06:32.720 --> 06:34.080
they check their phones quite often.

06:34.800 --> 06:36.800
And at some point it just becomes like a reflex

06:37.360 --> 06:38.800
and they don't even know they're checking it.

06:39.360 --> 06:41.520
But when they do look at it and the power's down

06:41.520 --> 06:45.920
or it goes yellow or it goes red, they get a little panicked.

06:45.920 --> 06:47.200
Like, oh my God, I got to charge it.

06:48.400 --> 06:50.960
Imagine my surprise when we're in like airports

06:50.960 --> 06:52.560
and they're like going out to people,

06:52.560 --> 06:54.720
can I use a little of your charge, right?

06:54.720 --> 06:55.680
I think we've all been there.

06:55.680 --> 06:57.440
We don't have a charger and usually like,

06:57.440 --> 06:58.400
I need something.

06:58.400 --> 06:59.360
Can somebody help me out?

07:00.080 --> 07:02.080
Most times people are really kind and they'll just,

07:02.080 --> 07:03.920
you know, kind of help you, especially if you're a kid.

07:04.800 --> 07:07.280
I thought about then putting it into zones

07:07.280 --> 07:08.880
and I put it into four zones.

07:08.880 --> 07:11.760
And I just said, you know, if you're at 75 to 100,

07:12.480 --> 07:13.360
you're probably fine.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.720
And meaning that, you know, you're in a zone

07:16.720 --> 07:17.840
where you're just moving along.

07:18.640 --> 07:22.400
If you're at 50 to 75, you're probably in a place

07:22.400 --> 07:25.280
where you might need to start to think about

07:25.280 --> 07:27.280
how you may want to recharge.

07:28.160 --> 07:30.240
If you're in that 25 to 50,

07:30.800 --> 07:33.120
it's time to start figuring out, take a break.

07:33.120 --> 07:34.560
You may need to take a walk.

07:34.560 --> 07:36.560
You may need to put down the phone.

07:36.560 --> 07:39.440
You may need to stop the litany of Zoom calls

07:39.440 --> 07:40.800
that you're on right now, right?

07:41.440 --> 07:43.760
And if you find yourself zero to 25,

07:44.400 --> 07:46.880
that's a real kind of indicator for you to say,

07:46.880 --> 07:48.880
hey, something's probably not right.

07:49.600 --> 07:52.480
And I need to really kind of take a hard stop

07:52.480 --> 07:54.080
and figure out how I recharge.

07:54.080 --> 07:56.480
And recharge can happen in a number of different ways.

07:57.200 --> 07:59.840
And so I've often talked about

07:59.840 --> 08:01.280
when I've gotten into that zone,

08:01.920 --> 08:03.760
I just kind of almost go for a walk.

08:04.880 --> 08:06.160
I sometimes go outside.

08:06.720 --> 08:07.760
I take some deep breaths.

08:08.320 --> 08:09.440
I do a number of things.

08:09.440 --> 08:10.800
Sometimes I may need a workout.

08:10.800 --> 08:13.680
A workout really helps me to recharge on a personal front.

08:14.320 --> 08:16.080
And everyone's a little bit different

08:16.080 --> 08:17.760
and they'll go to different techniques.

08:17.760 --> 08:19.760
And so in the book, I list a lot of things

08:19.760 --> 08:20.960
in the book that you may do.

08:21.600 --> 08:24.080
You may do one, two, three, four, or all of them.

08:24.640 --> 08:26.320
And they're just really techniques

08:26.320 --> 08:28.320
for you to figure out what works for you.

08:29.280 --> 08:31.600
Yeah, no, and I really like that breakdown

08:31.600 --> 08:33.680
because I think we're all better

08:33.680 --> 08:35.440
when we're measuring things with numbers.

08:35.440 --> 08:35.840
That's right.

08:35.840 --> 08:37.120
There's a specificity there.

08:37.120 --> 08:37.760
Yeah, yeah.

08:37.760 --> 08:39.040
And I'm one of those people,

08:39.040 --> 08:41.440
I think the way your phone is charged

08:41.440 --> 08:43.280
says so much about you as a person.

08:43.280 --> 08:45.200
So my phone is always charged.

08:45.200 --> 08:45.680
Yeah.

08:45.680 --> 08:50.320
I'm very rarely below 30% or 40% on my phone.

08:50.960 --> 08:54.080
And I think I try and monitor my personal health

08:54.080 --> 08:55.120
in a similar way.

08:55.120 --> 08:55.600
Right.

08:55.600 --> 08:58.080
As soon as I feel myself going below 50%,

08:59.040 --> 09:01.120
I know it's time for an early night.

09:01.120 --> 09:03.680
I know it's time to cancel weekend plans.

09:03.680 --> 09:06.560
I canceled a dinner this evening for that exact reason.

09:06.560 --> 09:06.960
Mm-hmm.

09:06.960 --> 09:08.640
I got back from work yesterday.

09:09.120 --> 09:12.160
I left, I started work yesterday at like 8.30 a.m.

09:12.160 --> 09:15.680
and I got back from a shoot at 9.30 p.m.

09:16.480 --> 09:18.320
And I knew I had a dinner tonight.

09:18.320 --> 09:21.440
And I just said, I'm so sorry, I can't make it.

09:21.440 --> 09:21.920
Good for you.

09:21.920 --> 09:23.280
Because I knew I had a busy day today.

09:23.280 --> 09:23.920
I was interviewing you.

09:23.920 --> 09:25.440
I was interviewing another guest.

09:25.440 --> 09:27.280
And I was like, I want to be really present for that.

09:27.280 --> 09:29.120
It's really critical stuff.

09:29.120 --> 09:31.920
And then I need to recharge using your word.

09:31.920 --> 09:33.520
I need to recharge this evening.

09:34.160 --> 09:37.600
And I'm always shifting things to recharge.

09:37.600 --> 09:40.720
And I love that idea because I think we hear the word rest.

09:41.280 --> 09:43.040
And then sometimes we feel guilty.

09:43.040 --> 09:44.400
We shouldn't, but we feel guilty.

09:44.400 --> 09:45.840
Like, I don't have time to rest.

09:45.840 --> 09:46.400
Yeah.

09:46.400 --> 09:48.240
But when you think of it about recharging,

09:48.240 --> 09:50.800
you're reframing it and going, oh, I do need to recharge.

09:50.800 --> 09:53.360
Because otherwise, how am I going to give my best tomorrow?

09:53.360 --> 09:54.080
100%.

09:54.080 --> 09:54.640
100%.

09:54.640 --> 09:55.920
And you know, it's funny.

09:55.920 --> 09:57.680
You and me are the same on batteries.

09:57.680 --> 09:59.920
I keep my battery pretty charged as well.

09:59.920 --> 10:01.680
I have an electric car too.

10:01.680 --> 10:05.520
I marvel at people who could take that electric car battery down to 5%.

10:05.520 --> 10:06.320
I can't do it.

10:06.320 --> 10:08.080
That stresses me out.

10:08.080 --> 10:10.240
I'm stressed out when they tell me these stories.

10:10.240 --> 10:11.920
Oh, I took the battery down to 5%.

10:11.920 --> 10:13.600
I'm like, seriously?

10:13.600 --> 10:14.240
How?

10:14.240 --> 10:15.840
I mean, and they're like, oh, it's fine.

10:16.560 --> 10:18.000
And for some people, it works, right?

10:18.000 --> 10:19.440
For me, that doesn't work.

10:19.440 --> 10:21.520
I'm plugging in that battery every night.

10:21.520 --> 10:24.160
And I'm going to make sure I charge that battery up.

10:24.160 --> 10:25.680
Others will let it go pretty low.

10:25.680 --> 10:27.040
Everyone's a little bit different.

10:27.040 --> 10:27.920
That works for them.

10:28.800 --> 10:31.520
I've asked some of my friends who charge it go really low.

10:31.520 --> 10:34.240
And they're like, well, if I charge it too much, I get stressed.

10:34.240 --> 10:36.800
I'm like, oh, OK, it can work the other way.

10:36.800 --> 10:37.680
Interesting.

10:37.680 --> 10:42.000
So it's got to kind of work for you and how you want to recharge

10:42.000 --> 10:44.000
and different techniques that you want to do.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.800
You're never really going to have a stress-free work environment.

10:46.800 --> 10:50.000
Anxiety, depression, and then starts to lead to physical ailments

10:50.000 --> 10:51.920
because we know there's a linkage.

10:51.920 --> 10:54.800
Good stress could lead to resilience.

10:54.800 --> 10:56.320
It could lead to growth.

10:56.320 --> 10:58.640
It actually could lead to a stronger culture.

10:58.640 --> 11:00.800
I was wondering if someone's at a zero,

11:00.800 --> 11:02.400
when you ask them, how's your battery?

11:02.400 --> 11:02.960
Yeah.

11:02.960 --> 11:06.480
And if someone says, I'm at five and I'm talking about emotionally,

11:06.480 --> 11:08.480
mentally, not their car or their phone,

11:10.000 --> 11:10.880
what would you say to them?

11:10.880 --> 11:15.520
How would you communicate with them some of these tools

11:15.520 --> 11:16.720
when you're at zero?

11:16.720 --> 11:21.280
I've learned to, like, take the space to give them space

11:21.280 --> 11:23.360
so we can actually have a proper conversation.

11:24.240 --> 11:27.440
If you find someone at a really low percentage,

11:27.440 --> 11:29.760
and I may ask that person, like, how are you doing?

11:29.760 --> 11:33.440
How are you feeling? And most of the time, you just want a,

11:33.440 --> 11:35.920
I'm good, because then you just want to keep going.

11:36.640 --> 11:39.040
And I find that often in the business world as well,

11:39.040 --> 11:41.200
not just in the personal world, but in the business world.

11:41.200 --> 11:43.520
We don't want a response,

11:44.240 --> 11:47.360
or sometimes we don't have the time to be like,

11:47.360 --> 11:50.560
if that person who you're asking the question to says,

11:50.560 --> 11:53.680
I'm not doing so hot and I'm not doing so well,

11:53.680 --> 11:54.400
then what do you do?

11:55.040 --> 11:58.400
So I'm very intentional when I ask some of these questions

11:58.960 --> 12:00.720
to individuals so that I give,

12:01.280 --> 12:03.840
I'm ready for that response if it's, I'm not doing well,

12:03.840 --> 12:05.760
like a 5%. So I kind of want to frame it there.

12:05.760 --> 12:06.560
I love that. Yeah.

12:06.560 --> 12:08.880
I think sometimes you rush through these conversations.

12:09.440 --> 12:12.080
And then when they do tell you they're a 5 or a 10,

12:12.080 --> 12:14.160
I think the best things that I have found

12:14.160 --> 12:15.520
is you have to be present for them.

12:16.160 --> 12:16.960
You have to listen.

12:16.960 --> 12:18.960
You do such a brilliant job at that, Jay,

12:18.960 --> 12:21.600
because even in this type of environment,

12:21.600 --> 12:23.680
we know as we have this one-to-one conversation,

12:23.680 --> 12:26.480
if I was telling you I was a 5 or a 0,

12:26.480 --> 12:29.200
you'd be all in on this and you would hear me out.

12:29.200 --> 12:30.960
And then you would start to tell me,

12:30.960 --> 12:33.440
okay, let's talk about what's causing that.

12:34.240 --> 12:37.680
And I've had at times where family members have come to me and said,

12:37.680 --> 12:39.120
hey, I'm at a 5.

12:40.080 --> 12:41.840
And we start to break it down.

12:41.840 --> 12:43.840
And I said, let me put it in another way for you.

12:44.480 --> 12:45.280
Think about your phone.

12:45.280 --> 12:47.600
And we do checks on our phone.

12:48.160 --> 12:50.800
And there's things on your phone that drain your battery

12:50.800 --> 12:52.160
more than other applications.

12:52.160 --> 12:54.400
And they're like, yeah, it's like when you go and

12:54.400 --> 12:57.120
Apple shows you what's draining or taking up all your memory.

12:57.680 --> 13:00.080
And what happens when you start to delete some of those things?

13:00.720 --> 13:04.080
Or what happens when you start to recognize what's causing it?

13:04.080 --> 13:06.960
They're like, oh, my battery is much more efficient.

13:06.960 --> 13:08.080
And I'm like, yeah.

13:08.080 --> 13:11.760
So what's causing that in your personal life right now?

13:11.760 --> 13:12.400
Yeah.

13:12.400 --> 13:16.160
And we try to create like, you know, analogies of different things.

13:16.160 --> 13:21.280
And so it doesn't become a space where all we're doing is talking about all the negativity.

13:21.280 --> 13:24.960
We're trying to draw parallels to different things in everyday life.

13:25.520 --> 13:28.640
And so that it doesn't become such a charged conversation.

13:28.640 --> 13:28.960
Yeah.

13:28.960 --> 13:29.280
Right.

13:29.280 --> 13:32.240
And that's kind of the recharge concept as well, where we're like,

13:32.240 --> 13:34.320
let's talk, let's talk about your mental health.

13:34.320 --> 13:37.040
Because sometimes some people don't want to talk about their mental health.

13:37.040 --> 13:37.600
Mm-hmm.

13:37.600 --> 13:40.880
But when we bring up the battery conversation or how to recharge,

13:40.880 --> 13:42.640
it's just a different framing.

13:42.640 --> 13:46.400
And again, this is something I think you just do brilliantly to bring everyone in.

13:47.200 --> 13:49.920
And I try to do the same thing there as well.

13:49.920 --> 13:50.160
Yeah.

13:50.160 --> 13:52.880
I was going to ask you that, actually, because I've always felt that with you.

13:53.520 --> 13:57.600
You've always been present at different touch points, whether we're at dinners, events,

13:58.560 --> 14:01.760
even when we've traveled and seen each other when we're in New York for a dinner,

14:01.760 --> 14:03.040
for time earlier this year.

14:03.040 --> 14:05.360
You're always present, too.

14:05.360 --> 14:07.360
And I wonder, how do you do that as a busy CEO?

14:07.360 --> 14:11.840
Because I think you're so right that when we ask the question, how are you doing,

14:12.880 --> 14:16.960
we are subconsciously hoping someone just says, I'm good.

14:17.600 --> 14:23.600
We are all, we almost ask the question and expect the response even before we have a response.

14:23.600 --> 14:24.240
You're so right.

14:24.240 --> 14:25.760
Like, that really resonated with me.

14:26.480 --> 14:30.560
And the truth is, sometimes life is fast for most of us, right?

14:30.560 --> 14:32.720
Our schedules are back to back to back.

14:32.720 --> 14:38.400
We are running from dropping your kid to school, running to work, picking up the laundry,

14:38.400 --> 14:40.160
doing the laundry, whatever, right?

14:40.160 --> 14:41.280
There's so much going on.

14:42.080 --> 14:47.040
How do you actually create space for these conversations?

14:47.040 --> 14:50.720
And that's part of being a lot more present and intentional.

14:51.200 --> 14:55.360
As leaders, and I'd be curious now for you as CEO as well,

14:56.480 --> 14:58.160
we're expected to have all the answers.

14:59.040 --> 15:01.840
We're expected to make many different types of decisions.

15:02.480 --> 15:05.920
We're expected to play roles in HR, but also company strategy.

15:06.560 --> 15:09.440
And, you know, when you take a step back, you can't make every decision.

15:10.160 --> 15:13.280
And then there's always things that don't, that are the unexpected.

15:13.760 --> 15:15.040
Take your car analogy.

15:15.040 --> 15:18.800
So when you had your car and you were at 30%, you were probably with someone.

15:18.800 --> 15:21.440
But in the back of your mind, you're going, how am I going to get home?

15:22.080 --> 15:23.120
Where am I going to charge?

15:24.080 --> 15:28.480
And you could do this probably better than most, but you still want to be present for that

15:28.480 --> 15:32.240
individual that you're with or your friends that you're with in those conversations.

15:32.960 --> 15:36.880
And what I find is like, sometimes we as leaders have to make the space.

15:37.840 --> 15:43.200
Sometimes we as leaders have to show something that you do absolutely brilliantly is to show

15:43.200 --> 15:46.320
a vulnerable side to them and talk about our own stories.

15:46.880 --> 15:50.560
I find that many CEOs today aren't vulnerable.

15:51.120 --> 15:53.680
I, for one, was not very good at being vulnerable.

15:54.240 --> 16:02.480
When I wrote the book though, I was just taken back at how many people who I met for the first time

16:02.480 --> 16:06.320
were so open and honest and vulnerable with myself.

16:07.200 --> 16:11.520
And it got me thinking, well, if they can do it, why can't I do it?

16:12.240 --> 16:12.560
Right?

16:12.560 --> 16:19.280
And if I started to show some of that vulnerability at work, if I started to give a little bit of space

16:19.280 --> 16:25.840
and more time for that conversation, would that then make it just more open for others

16:25.840 --> 16:28.480
and more safe for others to have the conversation?

16:29.120 --> 16:33.120
Because if I, if I'm not having that conversation and saying, here's my own journey,

16:34.000 --> 16:37.600
then they may feel that it's not okay for them to open up as well.

16:38.160 --> 16:38.400
Right?

16:39.120 --> 16:41.200
I just be curious, like you as CEO, right?

16:41.200 --> 16:43.520
You're, I mean, you've got all these different businesses.

16:43.520 --> 16:45.040
How do you do that with your own employees?

16:45.040 --> 16:49.360
Yeah, I think it's a, for me, it comes to the balance.

16:49.360 --> 16:51.280
So vulnerability is a great point.

16:51.280 --> 16:57.360
And, and I really appreciate that because I do agree that if you create space to share

16:57.360 --> 17:01.600
what you're going through with your teams, they then have the permission to do the same.

17:01.600 --> 17:07.120
And I think I was mentioning when we did a panel at Calm Coast a month ago or so,

17:07.840 --> 17:13.920
I was talking about a client of mine that I was coaching, who's the CEO of a very large corporation.

17:14.640 --> 17:19.040
And we'd gone through a transformation. They were saying to me, Jay, I'm, you know,

17:19.040 --> 17:22.000
I'm feeling good. And I was like, great. Well, you should tell your team about your journey.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.280
And they were like, how can I tell them?

17:23.280 --> 17:23.680
Right.

17:23.680 --> 17:26.080
And I said, what do you mean? And they said, well, if I tell them,

17:26.080 --> 17:28.320
they're going to think I'm weak. And I was like, no, I promise you,

17:28.320 --> 17:29.600
they're going to think you're strong.

17:30.240 --> 17:35.920
And I think we're still redefining and reframing strength in the world today.

17:35.920 --> 17:42.880
I think there are some of us who still see bravado and arrogance and chauvinism as being strong.

17:43.760 --> 17:47.120
And I think that's shifting, but it's shifting very slowly.

17:47.120 --> 17:48.640
That's right.

17:48.640 --> 17:56.640
It is a cultural expectation as well, societal expectation of strength being this kind of facade.

17:56.640 --> 17:58.640
But I think a lot of us are now realizing, well, no,

17:58.640 --> 18:03.200
strength is being able to show both sides and open up and be vulnerable.

18:03.200 --> 18:08.160
I think the other thing that really comes to mind when I'm thinking about being CEO is,

18:08.720 --> 18:11.840
I think stress can make people work harder,

18:13.120 --> 18:16.640
but it's the right amount of stress that makes someone work better.

18:16.640 --> 18:17.600
So good. So true.

18:17.600 --> 18:19.520
Right? There's a spectrum of stress.

18:19.520 --> 18:20.320
So true, so good.

18:20.320 --> 18:22.640
If I just keep checking in with someone and go, have you done it yet?

18:23.200 --> 18:26.960
Are you done yet? Why are we not there yet? Why did the numbers not triple this?

18:26.960 --> 18:30.320
If I do that, they're going to feel stressed and they may work harder,

18:30.320 --> 18:31.600
but that doesn't mean they work better.

18:31.600 --> 18:32.160
That's right.

18:32.160 --> 18:35.760
And so to me, the right amount of stress, and I want to ask you this as well,

18:36.400 --> 18:41.440
talk to me about the difference between good stress and bad stress and how you've been able

18:41.440 --> 18:44.400
to harness the right amount when you've got it right.

18:44.400 --> 18:49.600
In the book, actually, I interviewed Dr. Aditi Nurikar and you met her.

18:49.600 --> 18:50.560
Yeah. She's wonderful.

18:50.560 --> 18:51.520
Fantastic. Right.

18:52.160 --> 18:55.600
And we got into this whole conversation of good stress, bad stress.

18:56.320 --> 18:59.600
You stress, good stress versus bad stress, distress.

18:59.600 --> 19:05.760
And, you know, we talked about how good stress could lead to resilience.

19:05.760 --> 19:07.280
It could lead to growth.

19:07.280 --> 19:09.280
It actually could lead to a stronger culture.

19:10.560 --> 19:13.280
You're never really going to have a stress-free work environment.

19:13.280 --> 19:13.840
Agreed.

19:13.840 --> 19:15.600
You know, we're always going to have stress at work.

19:16.160 --> 19:17.440
We're all going to have deadlines.

19:17.440 --> 19:19.920
We're all going to have things we're going to want to hit.

19:19.920 --> 19:26.000
But not everything has to be, just like you said, 24-7, 365.

19:26.640 --> 19:31.920
Because at some point, it's going to stack so much that you as a leader are realizing you're

19:31.920 --> 19:33.440
probably not being very efficient.

19:33.440 --> 19:38.480
Your employees are probably not working super efficiently, not working well together.

19:38.480 --> 19:42.000
And they're probably, you've caused a lot of bad stress, distress in their life.

19:42.000 --> 19:46.320
That's leading to things like anxiety, depression, and then starts to lead to physical ailments.

19:46.320 --> 19:52.160
Because we know there's a linkage between, you know, your mental health and your physical health.

19:52.160 --> 19:56.080
And so that becomes a very vicious cycle, especially in the workplace.

19:56.080 --> 19:59.040
And that leads to a lot of unproductivity.

19:59.040 --> 20:04.560
What I've found with the two is you really have to find that right balance and understand there

20:04.560 --> 20:06.960
will be, and just talk about it.

20:06.960 --> 20:07.680
There's a push.

20:07.680 --> 20:08.800
We're all going to make a push.

20:09.440 --> 20:14.400
We did it recently as a company at Calm around the elections.

20:14.960 --> 20:20.000
And we treated the elections like our Super Bowl moment because we knew, and we saw the data,

20:20.000 --> 20:25.760
that people's stress was rising every day as that day, November 5th, got closer and closer.

20:25.760 --> 20:26.800
We saw it in the App Store.

20:26.800 --> 20:27.760
We saw it in comments.

20:27.760 --> 20:29.520
We saw it on social.

20:29.520 --> 20:35.200
So we really came together as a company to do different types of things around that.

20:35.200 --> 20:38.160
Take a breath, 30 seconds or 15 seconds of silence.

20:39.280 --> 20:44.240
We showed animals from the San Diego Zoo on Instagram.

20:44.240 --> 20:48.800
And we got so many people commenting that day that said, hey, thank you for the silence.

20:49.520 --> 20:55.120
Thank you for my 15 seconds in this world where so many things are happening.

20:55.120 --> 20:58.800
Now, people were dialing in from work because they were stressed at work.

20:58.800 --> 21:00.480
Stress doesn't just mean it's at home.

21:00.480 --> 21:03.280
It was like people were like during the elections coming in from work.

21:03.280 --> 21:07.920
And so we wanted to give them a little bit so they had a release so they could be more productive.

21:08.480 --> 21:14.080
So there's a lot of things around stuff that I look at for good stress and bad stress and recognize

21:14.080 --> 21:18.800
there's always going to be a push-pull, but that's the part where you can't do it alone.

21:18.800 --> 21:19.760
You got to have a good team.

21:19.760 --> 21:20.720
You got to talk about it.

21:20.720 --> 21:26.480
You do this so well and make sure that becomes part of your fabric, your culture, your DNA.

21:27.280 --> 21:30.800
And I think it's shifting, but it's slow.

21:30.800 --> 21:31.440
Yeah.

21:31.440 --> 21:34.480
I think the conversation around mental health in everyday life,

21:35.600 --> 21:38.720
it's the most approachable it's ever been, right?

21:38.720 --> 21:41.680
I talk about things with my own kids today around mental health.

21:42.320 --> 21:46.560
When I was a child coming, you know, I'd be curious, like for you, like immigrant family,

21:47.120 --> 21:50.080
we didn't talk about our mental health in my household, right?

21:50.080 --> 21:54.000
We talked more about powering through things and I can talk about that later,

21:54.000 --> 21:55.440
but we didn't really talk about it.

21:55.440 --> 21:59.680
My kids talk about it. They may overuse it at times, not use it the right way.

22:00.480 --> 22:02.640
It's okay. They're having the conversation.

22:02.640 --> 22:05.360
Their friends are having the conversation. I think that's great.

22:06.320 --> 22:10.480
But when you go to the workplace, it kind of stops, you know?

22:10.480 --> 22:13.760
And I go to so many places and I'm like, do you talk about your mental health at work?

22:13.760 --> 22:14.400
And they're like, no.

22:15.120 --> 22:17.280
And I'm like, well, let's change that dialogue.

22:17.840 --> 22:21.120
Let's make it as approachable as it is in everyday life.

22:21.120 --> 22:24.560
And how do we start to do that? Let's give you the tools and we'll start at the top.

22:24.560 --> 22:26.160
Yeah, you're so right. You're so right.

22:26.160 --> 22:32.080
What you're painting a picture of for me is that I look at the good stress being

22:32.080 --> 22:34.640
when we all know what challenge we're up against.

22:35.360 --> 22:38.800
We know what the goal is and everyone feels supported.

22:39.360 --> 22:43.680
And I think what often happens is people don't know what the goal is

22:43.680 --> 22:45.680
because you're not helping them do that.

22:45.680 --> 22:48.720
They only see the challenge and they don't feel supported.

22:48.720 --> 22:49.440
That's right.

22:49.440 --> 22:54.080
So now they don't know where they're going and they feel if they fall flat on their face,

22:54.080 --> 22:55.360
they have nothing to catch them.

22:55.360 --> 22:56.160
That's right.

22:56.160 --> 23:00.640
As a leader, the goal is to provide the goal and the support.

23:00.640 --> 23:02.720
And then the person can focus on the challenge.

23:02.720 --> 23:05.120
Yeah. And be transparent in that journey.

23:05.120 --> 23:09.600
You know, I speak to many CEOs in the Valley and over the world.

23:09.600 --> 23:14.160
And, you know, a lot of times I'll ask them, how do you prioritize things with your employees?

23:14.160 --> 23:15.760
How transparent are you?

23:15.760 --> 23:18.320
And I'll tell you, many of them are not that transparent.

23:18.320 --> 23:20.240
Or they'll be like, these are the most important things.

23:21.200 --> 23:24.240
And then they'll add five more and then five more.

23:24.240 --> 23:25.600
Right. And I'll be like, oh, okay.

23:26.320 --> 23:27.520
What did you take away?

23:28.160 --> 23:29.360
And they're like, what are you talking about?

23:29.360 --> 23:31.680
I mean, what did you take away?

23:32.480 --> 23:34.880
And they're like, nothing.

23:35.440 --> 23:38.400
And I'm like, well, how do you think that's affecting your employees?

23:39.040 --> 23:41.120
And they're like, I never really thought about that.

23:41.680 --> 23:46.800
So I've just compounded and stacked the problem as a leader.

23:46.800 --> 23:53.600
And you didn't take anything away and it cascades down like a megaphone.

23:54.240 --> 23:59.040
Think about what that employee is going through and walk in their shoes for a minute.

23:59.760 --> 24:05.040
You know, we at the top have the luxury of having more control over our schedules.

24:06.080 --> 24:08.800
But that person may not have as much control over their schedule.

24:08.800 --> 24:10.480
They're just ticking through things.

24:10.480 --> 24:10.960
Yeah.

24:10.960 --> 24:16.240
And if you just keep adding and not taking certain things away and saying, this is important.

24:16.240 --> 24:17.360
This isn't important.

24:17.360 --> 24:18.400
Here's how I think about it.

24:18.400 --> 24:19.760
Here's how I'm being transparent.

24:20.480 --> 24:22.240
You're adding more stress to your company.

24:22.240 --> 24:25.200
You know, leaders struggle with how to be vulnerable.

24:25.200 --> 24:26.560
Is it going to be used against me?

24:26.560 --> 24:27.040
Yeah.

24:27.040 --> 24:29.360
Is someone going to write about it and say I'm too weak?

24:29.360 --> 24:32.480
Is the board going to think I'm weak as a leader?

24:32.480 --> 24:36.800
That's ultimately also a fail of corporate stewardship.

24:36.800 --> 24:39.520
Because they have to also look after your mental health.

24:39.520 --> 24:41.120
At Calm, I love this.

24:41.120 --> 24:46.400
When I first got introduced to Calm and started taking calls with the teams

24:46.400 --> 24:50.640
and I took my role of chief purpose officer, I got integrated into the culture.

24:51.520 --> 24:56.880
I loved the little things and the focus on the little things at meetings at Calm,

24:56.880 --> 24:58.880
whether they're on Zoom, in person.

24:58.880 --> 25:04.240
I want to hear about these smaller things that are happening on a daily basis.

25:04.240 --> 25:07.840
Because I think often companies think they need to put out a thing that says,

25:07.840 --> 25:11.360
we're focusing on company mental health and they're doing these big things.

25:11.360 --> 25:16.320
But Calm internally, let alone the work they do with other companies and workplaces,

25:16.320 --> 25:23.040
but Calm internally had some really nice cultural things that I noticed from the outside in

25:23.040 --> 25:24.720
as I was being integrated.

25:24.720 --> 25:28.640
Walk us through some of those daily things that you think create the rituals and practices

25:28.880 --> 25:29.840
that help people.

25:29.840 --> 25:35.360
It was interesting for me, my first day at Calm, I walk in and they're Michael and Alex,

25:35.360 --> 25:36.880
who you know well, the founders, right?

25:36.880 --> 25:37.520
Yeah, I love them.

25:37.520 --> 25:40.720
And they love you and they talk about you all the time and how you all first met.

25:41.600 --> 25:46.960
And they introduced me to the company, warm welcome, so inviting.

25:47.600 --> 25:51.040
And they started the whole all hands off with a meditation.

25:52.640 --> 25:53.920
And I wasn't really used to that.

25:54.800 --> 25:59.920
You know, and I was I was kind of sitting there and I kind of noticed everyone.

25:59.920 --> 26:02.160
And normally we listen to someone like yourself.

26:02.160 --> 26:06.000
We'll turn you on or we'll turn one of our other kind of narrators on.

26:06.000 --> 26:06.720
They do great.

26:07.280 --> 26:09.520
And everyone just kind of sat there in the moment.

26:09.520 --> 26:12.560
And whether it was sometimes it's, you know, really quick, 30 seconds,

26:12.560 --> 26:14.960
sometimes it's five, six minutes, something three minutes.

26:15.760 --> 26:20.160
And they listened and it was and I kind of was peeking at times looking.

26:20.160 --> 26:24.000
I'm like, is everyone kind of closing their eyes, you know, around here, you know, looking there.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.480
And they were just in the moment.

26:26.480 --> 26:29.440
It was a moment for me that showed me how much they cared.

26:30.160 --> 26:31.840
And I was like, wow, this company cares.

26:32.560 --> 26:33.840
This isn't forced.

26:33.840 --> 26:34.960
You don't have to be here.

26:34.960 --> 26:36.480
You don't have to do this.

26:36.480 --> 26:39.120
And they were there and they were present and they were in the moment.

26:39.920 --> 26:40.960
So that's like some of this.

26:40.960 --> 26:43.680
That was one of the ways I knew this company was going to be different.

26:44.560 --> 26:50.880
And then I watched as the company did things around gratitude, where we end every all hands

26:50.880 --> 26:51.680
with gratitude.

26:52.240 --> 26:57.680
We read things that have come into us and it's a reminder of the impact we're having.

26:58.400 --> 27:04.720
And I think that's why sometimes I'm so stressed because I feel this weight of responsibility

27:05.280 --> 27:08.160
where every second of every day someone is using the product.

27:08.880 --> 27:15.280
And I just feel like if we're not answering them or not helping them in the moment,

27:15.280 --> 27:16.960
someone's not getting something that they need.

27:17.920 --> 27:21.040
And I feel that stress and I feel the response.

27:21.040 --> 27:22.240
It's really responsibility.

27:22.240 --> 27:22.560
Yeah.

27:22.560 --> 27:24.880
And I talk about that with the employees.

27:25.440 --> 27:27.360
And I think it's really important to talk about that.

27:27.360 --> 27:29.120
So we do the gratitude piece at the end.

27:29.680 --> 27:35.120
We have zoom free days, you know, where I talk to employees about,

27:35.120 --> 27:40.400
hey, if you're in a moment where you find yourself in five zooms, take a beat.

27:40.960 --> 27:42.080
You don't need to do that.

27:42.080 --> 27:45.360
And if there's meetings that don't make sense, just like you did tonight, which was great.

27:46.080 --> 27:47.840
Just say, no, it's okay.

27:47.840 --> 27:49.360
You know, we'll figure it out.

27:50.000 --> 27:50.880
And I do that too.

27:50.880 --> 27:56.000
And I try to be a lot more purposeful now because it helps me then be more present

27:56.000 --> 27:57.600
in the meetings that I need to be in.

27:57.600 --> 27:58.000
Yeah.

27:58.000 --> 27:58.720
Right.

27:58.720 --> 28:02.400
And rather than saying, it's not the quantity of meetings that I'm in,

28:02.400 --> 28:04.720
it's those quality of meeting moments that I'm in.

28:05.280 --> 28:12.320
And I think people sometimes like misinterpret like quantity for productivity versus like value.

28:12.960 --> 28:18.160
And I'm much more like, okay, I'm going to do, I'm going to focus on quality.

28:18.160 --> 28:19.120
And it may mean less.

28:19.760 --> 28:22.240
And that doesn't have to sacrifice my impact.

28:22.240 --> 28:24.720
I was going to ask you, how does it impact productivity?

28:25.440 --> 28:29.280
And I do think that we've convinced ourselves that if I'm doing more,

28:29.280 --> 28:33.440
if there's more on my schedule, if I'm jumping around, we've created

28:34.240 --> 28:39.520
our definition of value to be around busyness, right?

28:39.520 --> 28:40.320
Yes.

28:40.320 --> 28:44.800
And we all feel we're more important, valuable, and it's subconscious.

28:44.800 --> 28:48.720
Again, you just think, oh yeah, if I've got a lot to do, then I must be doing something.

28:48.720 --> 28:49.280
Yeah.

28:49.280 --> 28:51.360
How do we start to shift that conversation?

28:51.360 --> 28:52.800
What have you learned about that?

28:52.800 --> 28:56.240
I know you interviewed some amazing people as well, as you were saying inside the book.

28:56.240 --> 29:00.080
What did you learn about how we can reframe what we believe makes us valuable?

29:00.080 --> 29:00.880
Yeah, yeah.

29:00.880 --> 29:07.360
So I had, so two people in particular, so John Scully, for example, the former CEO of Apple,

29:08.320 --> 29:12.000
he talked about how in the book he was chief listening officer.

29:12.640 --> 29:14.160
And I was like, really?

29:14.160 --> 29:14.880
And he's like, yeah.

29:15.600 --> 29:18.800
Like Steve asked that we make our own business cards.

29:19.760 --> 29:21.680
And I wrote chief listening officer.

29:22.320 --> 29:25.680
And I sat there and I was like, wow, that's, that was great.

29:26.400 --> 29:27.600
You listen.

29:27.600 --> 29:32.000
And so, because so often, you know, you just start talking.

29:32.720 --> 29:39.760
And he's like, no, I became a lot more purposeful if I just listened first, said probably less.

29:40.720 --> 29:44.960
But that impact was greater because I heard what was happening and I thought that was great.

29:45.840 --> 29:49.920
I had Jack Rowe, who's a former CEO of Aetna in the book, he came over and he said,

29:51.200 --> 29:53.280
sometimes you have to put yourself into neutral.

29:53.920 --> 29:57.760
And he's like, and you have to give yourself space because you can't run at 100 miles an hour.

29:58.320 --> 30:03.280
And if you don't give yourself a little bit of a break, no matter what position you're in,

30:04.240 --> 30:09.680
you're going to find yourself upside down and you're not going to figure out how to turn back up.

30:10.640 --> 30:16.720
And I appreciated those conversations with them because they're a little bit more old school in

30:16.720 --> 30:17.360
their approach.

30:18.400 --> 30:21.200
They think we're a little bit more in the middle now.

30:21.200 --> 30:24.240
And then there's a younger generation, right, that's coming up with things about things completely

30:24.240 --> 30:29.680
different. It's been such a privilege to be able to kind of talk to so many different people

30:30.400 --> 30:34.400
who are in that continuum to kind of hear how they're managing it, right?

30:35.040 --> 30:37.920
Even like how you think about things today and how you manage all that, right?

30:37.920 --> 30:41.920
It just must be a lot coming at you today from many different angles when they're like,

30:41.920 --> 30:43.040
Jay, what do you do?

30:43.040 --> 30:48.800
Yeah, yeah. And I think for me, it is the old cliche, but it's so true.

30:48.800 --> 30:50.640
Like you are only as good as your team.

30:51.360 --> 30:55.040
And I do think being a leader means taking care of your team.

30:55.040 --> 30:56.000
That's right.

30:56.000 --> 31:00.480
In one sense, I feel like that's all a leader actually has to do is be the coach,

31:00.480 --> 31:05.680
therapist, support system or provide and bring those things in for the team.

31:05.680 --> 31:07.600
And you almost become a coach.

31:07.600 --> 31:08.000
Right.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.520
And yes, you're being strategic.

31:09.520 --> 31:10.880
Yes, you're being a visionary.

31:11.440 --> 31:16.000
But a lot of it is just loving people and supporting people.

31:16.000 --> 31:19.760
I find at least, I find like that's what most of my time is taken up.

31:19.760 --> 31:20.480
100%.

31:20.480 --> 31:23.280
Doing because everyone has their emotions.

31:23.280 --> 31:25.600
And as long as you have smart people that you're working with,

31:26.400 --> 31:30.000
then those people are the people that investing in them as humans.

31:30.000 --> 31:30.480
Yeah.

31:30.480 --> 31:32.640
Is allowing them to do what you trust them to do.

31:32.640 --> 31:33.200
That's right.

31:33.200 --> 31:37.760
But the thing that's holding them back is usually something emotional or mental.

31:37.760 --> 31:40.000
It's rarely professional that people have challenges.

31:40.000 --> 31:42.880
And I find it's something they're going through in their personal life.

31:43.440 --> 31:45.120
It's a mental block that they have.

31:45.120 --> 31:45.920
Yeah.

31:45.920 --> 31:49.280
And if that doesn't get healed and accessed in the workplace,

31:50.000 --> 31:51.840
that's going to be the spanner in the works.

31:51.840 --> 31:55.680
Like that's going to be the thing that bottlenecks the process,

31:55.680 --> 31:58.640
creates inefficiency, creates a lack of trust.

31:58.640 --> 31:59.120
That's right.

31:59.120 --> 32:00.800
That's the kind of stuff that gets in the way.

32:00.800 --> 32:01.200
Yeah.

32:01.200 --> 32:03.920
And a lot of times too, when you talk to people,

32:03.920 --> 32:06.640
they have no idea what's happening outside the workplace.

32:06.640 --> 32:07.360
Mm-hmm.

32:07.360 --> 32:11.760
You know, but so much that happens outside the workplace affects the workplace.

32:12.640 --> 32:17.200
It's really important for companies too, to have mental health support tools for employees.

32:17.200 --> 32:20.240
So when they need things, people to talk to, you know, applications,

32:20.240 --> 32:23.360
whether they're calm or others, therapy, if they need it,

32:24.080 --> 32:28.000
if they just make those available and known, that's another step in the process.

32:28.000 --> 32:28.240
Yeah.

32:28.240 --> 32:30.560
So that's why I always tell people, it's not just one thing.

32:30.560 --> 32:33.120
It's kind of like a number of things you have to put together,

32:33.120 --> 32:35.920
because people may take bits and pieces of each to make it their own.

32:36.720 --> 32:39.440
But it kind of shows them when they need it, it's there.

32:39.440 --> 32:39.760
Yeah.

32:39.760 --> 32:42.480
And a lot of times people will go look for things on their own.

32:42.480 --> 32:45.520
You know, they'll search and they'll see if you got tools and what companies.

32:46.400 --> 32:49.200
And I do find that you sometimes will lose good people

32:49.200 --> 32:51.520
because you're not supporting them in their journey.

32:51.520 --> 32:51.920
Yeah.

32:51.920 --> 32:56.720
And so the more you could be there for them and they know that,

32:57.360 --> 33:01.760
they become some of your most loyal, most productive,

33:01.760 --> 33:05.280
most culture bearing, you know, carrying the flag employees.

33:05.280 --> 33:05.600
Yeah.

33:05.600 --> 33:06.800
And you didn't have to tell them to do it.

33:06.800 --> 33:08.400
They just kind of did it on their own.

33:08.400 --> 33:09.120
Absolutely.

33:09.120 --> 33:11.680
And I feel like those often are the best ones.

33:12.480 --> 33:15.040
And I, and we have a lot of those.

33:15.840 --> 33:19.120
And I'm very, and I just feel very privileged that we have so many folks like that,

33:19.840 --> 33:22.480
that they just care deeply and it's personal for them.

33:23.760 --> 33:26.400
My previous company I had started was a caregiving company.

33:27.360 --> 33:32.080
And one thing I noticed in that company was that so many people that were caring for

33:32.080 --> 33:35.040
others were suffering, right?

33:35.040 --> 33:40.560
They, and then they had to go to work and people had no idea that they were doing like five jobs,

33:41.360 --> 33:43.920
caregiver, they were worrying about their finances.

33:43.920 --> 33:46.000
They were trying to figure out how they help people.

33:46.000 --> 33:49.600
And then they had to go to work and, and they had a litany of things they had to go do.

33:49.600 --> 33:53.120
And most people have no idea all these things are going on in their people's lives,

33:53.120 --> 33:53.280
right?

33:53.280 --> 33:54.800
Because sometimes we just don't ask the question.

33:55.360 --> 33:59.280
And because we're so busy ourselves, or sometimes we don't want to ask the question

33:59.280 --> 34:01.680
because we're so busy ourselves, we can't take anything else off.

34:02.320 --> 34:09.040
But I just feel that if we are just more aware and we create space for employees and we listen to

34:09.040 --> 34:12.800
what they have to say, flexible work schedules, what are they asking for?

34:12.800 --> 34:15.200
That's why I constantly poll our employees as well.

34:15.840 --> 34:16.800
What do you value?

34:17.600 --> 34:18.880
And they'll tell us.

34:19.600 --> 34:23.120
And then if we have stuff that they don't want, we put it away.

34:23.120 --> 34:25.920
I sometimes like, oh, all my employees want this gym membership.

34:26.480 --> 34:27.520
And then nobody uses it.

34:29.440 --> 34:31.680
And, and they're like, just ask.

34:31.680 --> 34:32.240
Yeah.

34:32.240 --> 34:37.120
And I'm like, now I just ask, let's have our team go out and say, here are the top 10 things.

34:37.120 --> 34:37.840
What do you want?

34:37.840 --> 34:38.560
Yeah.

34:38.560 --> 34:41.520
And then we'll take away a couple of things that they don't use, you know,

34:41.520 --> 34:44.240
and we'll try to ask that almost every year.

34:44.240 --> 34:44.800
Totally.

34:44.800 --> 34:46.560
I, I, I couldn't agree more.

34:46.560 --> 34:48.720
We, I love gift giving.

34:48.720 --> 34:50.000
It's one of my love languages.

34:50.000 --> 34:53.600
And you were so kind to bring me a gift today, which was very thoughtful

34:53.600 --> 34:57.760
and very useful and both of which I will use.

34:57.760 --> 35:01.120
And the reason I'm saying that is I love giving gifts too.

35:01.840 --> 35:05.280
And so, you know, over the years, when it comes around the holidays,

35:05.280 --> 35:06.960
I love getting gifts for my team.

35:07.760 --> 35:11.440
And for a long time, I'd always be guessing like what everyone wanted.

35:12.160 --> 35:16.000
And you assume that something's cool or trending or whatever it may be.

35:16.000 --> 35:19.440
And then you start to realize what you just said, people didn't really want that.

35:19.440 --> 35:20.080
Yeah.

35:20.080 --> 35:22.320
And then at one point we were like, okay, well then we won't give gifts.

35:22.320 --> 35:24.720
We'll just, you know, thank people and whatever else it was.

35:24.720 --> 35:27.120
But then we were like, no, but people like, people like it.

35:27.120 --> 35:27.280
Yeah.

35:27.280 --> 35:28.480
Everyone enjoys it.

35:28.480 --> 35:29.280
And so, it's so funny.

35:29.280 --> 35:31.120
We've started polling over the last few years.

35:31.120 --> 35:32.960
Like what kind of gift would everyone like?

35:32.960 --> 35:35.600
And the number one answer this year was infrared masks.

35:35.600 --> 35:37.040
Like, so what are you calling out here?

35:37.040 --> 35:37.760
Yeah.

35:37.760 --> 35:39.120
That was the number one request.

35:39.120 --> 35:39.920
Yeah, that's great.

35:39.920 --> 35:40.480
The red light.

35:40.480 --> 35:41.040
Yeah.

35:41.040 --> 35:42.160
So that was the number one request.

35:42.160 --> 35:43.120
And we're like, oh, easy.

35:43.120 --> 35:44.800
Now we know what everyone wants.

35:45.360 --> 35:49.760
So we're going to get that because it's easier rather than us guessing.

35:49.760 --> 35:50.160
Yeah.

35:50.160 --> 35:55.280
And I agree that I do think people inside of organizations today want mental health tools.

35:55.280 --> 35:55.440
That's right.

35:55.440 --> 35:57.440
They want meditation practices.

35:57.440 --> 36:01.680
They want mindfulness opportunities and tools and apps and everything else.

36:01.680 --> 36:04.000
I do believe there is a big demand for that.

36:04.480 --> 36:06.400
And I think it's only growing.

36:06.400 --> 36:06.960
Oh, yeah.

36:06.960 --> 36:10.400
Because people are feeling that if you don't have that,

36:10.960 --> 36:13.200
you can't have that conversation in the workplace.

36:13.200 --> 36:13.600
That's right.

36:13.600 --> 36:17.280
I think this is the part that I want companies and leaders to understand.

36:17.280 --> 36:22.000
If you're not providing tools to support people with their mental health,

36:22.800 --> 36:26.240
they don't have a vehicle to talk about it at work.

36:26.240 --> 36:26.720
That's right.

36:26.720 --> 36:29.760
If it's available to everyone and they see it come out in the newsletter

36:29.760 --> 36:33.200
and the team's available and everyone knows about it, they can say,

36:33.200 --> 36:34.800
oh, yeah, did you see we're using Calm now?

36:34.800 --> 36:36.720
And, you know, I've been doing this one.

36:36.720 --> 36:37.840
And which one have you been doing?

36:37.840 --> 36:42.320
And now it allows for connection and conversation and community,

36:42.320 --> 36:45.280
as opposed to without it, someone may just never talk about the fact

36:45.280 --> 36:47.200
that they've been struggling to sleep for seven days.

36:47.200 --> 36:47.920
A hundred percent.

36:47.920 --> 36:48.320
Right?

36:48.320 --> 36:48.800
A hundred percent.

36:48.800 --> 36:52.080
And I find that, too, amongst the younger generation,

36:52.720 --> 36:53.920
they just expect these things.

36:53.920 --> 36:54.400
Yeah.

36:54.400 --> 36:56.160
You know, and they're asking for them.

36:56.160 --> 36:58.240
And they'll give up other things along the way.

36:58.240 --> 36:58.640
Yeah.

36:58.640 --> 37:00.800
And so, and they're very vocal around it.

37:01.440 --> 37:03.760
And we've seen it now in all industries.

37:04.320 --> 37:06.000
You know, we've seen it happen in banking,

37:06.000 --> 37:08.080
where people feel like, hey, you're not listening.

37:08.720 --> 37:13.200
And it takes a moment where they have to go to the press almost.

37:13.200 --> 37:13.600
Right?

37:13.600 --> 37:15.200
It shouldn't have to ever get there.

37:15.200 --> 37:15.760
Yeah.

37:15.760 --> 37:19.920
If they were listening to those kids and listening to your employees,

37:20.480 --> 37:22.560
then you've got a continuous feedback loop.

37:22.560 --> 37:23.120
Yeah.

37:23.120 --> 37:24.960
More companies, the baseline will be,

37:24.960 --> 37:26.960
you have to have these services going forward.

37:27.680 --> 37:31.680
And, and I think over time, then that will open up a dialogue.

37:32.400 --> 37:34.400
And I also think with CEOs today, I'll tell you,

37:34.400 --> 37:36.000
because it starts so much at the top.

37:36.960 --> 37:39.120
If you start to have some of these conversations and say,

37:39.120 --> 37:40.160
here's how I think about it.

37:40.160 --> 37:42.000
Here's how you're being vulnerable.

37:42.000 --> 37:43.920
That too opens up a different conversation.

37:44.640 --> 37:47.440
And then that can just kind of percolate within the company.

37:48.080 --> 37:51.760
And, and then I think the whole thing starts to move faster.

37:52.320 --> 37:52.800
Right?

37:52.800 --> 37:55.920
And then we can start to get more into a conversation of like,

37:55.920 --> 37:58.880
okay, now how do we get you the right care at the right time

37:58.880 --> 38:00.480
when you need it, however you need it?

38:01.280 --> 38:05.360
Because so much of the conversation we're having right now is pretty basic in my mind.

38:06.000 --> 38:09.120
And we just need to get farther along in the conversation.

38:09.120 --> 38:09.440
Yeah.

38:09.440 --> 38:14.320
I think a lot of people will question listening to us going,

38:15.120 --> 38:20.240
well, how does mindfulness or meditation actually help burnout?

38:20.240 --> 38:21.920
Well, how does it help stress?

38:21.920 --> 38:22.800
So that's one thing.

38:22.800 --> 38:24.320
And I mean, there's tons of science on that,

38:24.320 --> 38:27.280
but I think there's still, so I want, I want you to answer that.

38:27.280 --> 38:31.200
And the second thing is, well, how does this affect my productivity?

38:31.200 --> 38:31.440
Right?

38:31.440 --> 38:35.600
Like how does it actually get people to do the work that I need them to do?

38:35.600 --> 38:36.000
Sure.

38:36.000 --> 38:40.720
And isn't this just a distraction or slows them down?

38:40.720 --> 38:44.640
Because I know a lot of organizations just feel like this sounds good in theory,

38:44.640 --> 38:45.520
but how does it help?

38:45.520 --> 38:49.600
So if we could talk about how mindfulness and meditation, specifically the programs

38:49.600 --> 38:53.520
that exist on Calm, how do they make sense for stress and burnout?

38:53.520 --> 38:55.920
Then how do they make sense for productivity and performance?

38:55.920 --> 38:56.160
Yeah.

38:56.160 --> 38:57.440
I mean, I think I have both of those.

38:57.440 --> 39:00.640
I'll start with the second one first because it comes up a lot.

39:01.520 --> 39:06.000
And what I often tell people is when, I'll just use Calm as an example,

39:06.640 --> 39:10.080
more than half the people that use Calm today come to us for sleep.

39:10.080 --> 39:13.760
And they're having moments where they just can't fall asleep.

39:13.760 --> 39:17.520
Most of that comes, as we know, because they're sleeping next to their devices.

39:17.520 --> 39:19.520
The devices are constantly beeping.

39:19.520 --> 39:20.640
They don't shut them off.

39:21.200 --> 39:26.000
I talk about like, it's hard, but you know, I keep my phone outside my bedroom.

39:26.000 --> 39:27.520
Not everyone does that.

39:27.520 --> 39:28.800
When I travel, I don't do that.

39:29.440 --> 39:34.400
And sometimes it leads to, you know, not a good sleep.

39:35.120 --> 39:38.560
And we know when you have a number of those days that start to compound,

39:39.280 --> 39:41.200
it could lead to irritability.

39:41.200 --> 39:45.440
It could lead to not being as productive the next day when you go to work,

39:45.440 --> 39:47.680
because you're just tired, right?

39:48.240 --> 39:51.920
You couple that at times with potentially bad eating habits

39:52.560 --> 39:56.320
or some people drinking habits or other types of habits that aren't.

39:56.880 --> 40:00.480
And that doesn't create, and it creates kind of like what I call negative behavior.

40:01.040 --> 40:04.400
I had that when I was younger because I didn't understand some of these tools.

40:05.200 --> 40:08.160
And I just wish I had some of these tools when I was younger,

40:08.160 --> 40:11.680
because I didn't, I didn't do those things that created positive behavior change.

40:11.680 --> 40:17.040
Um, when I was in banking, for example, I, and when I got stressed,

40:17.920 --> 40:20.880
I turned to smoking and I was just a kid.

40:20.880 --> 40:23.440
And I was like smoking in the stairwell of Solomon brothers.

40:24.080 --> 40:25.760
I shouldn't have been smoking in the stairwell.

40:25.760 --> 40:26.560
That's number one.

40:27.360 --> 40:33.520
I talked about this with our employees saying, Hey, I didn't have apps like calm or tools

40:33.520 --> 40:34.640
to help me in the moment.

40:35.120 --> 40:36.080
I wish I did.

40:36.080 --> 40:41.360
I probably would have turned to other things and understood that's positive behavior

40:41.360 --> 40:43.200
that I could turn to not negative behavior.

40:43.840 --> 40:47.120
And if I have enough of that, then it starts to kind of change the pendulum

40:47.120 --> 40:49.840
because I then ended up on a very slippery slope.

40:49.840 --> 40:52.560
You know, you're smoking, you start to drink a little bit more,

40:52.560 --> 40:54.960
then I'm eating more at odd hours.

40:54.960 --> 40:55.920
And then I try to go to sleep.

40:56.480 --> 40:59.520
And you just know if you're trying to eat Chinese food at 1130,

40:59.520 --> 41:03.280
and you want to go to bed at 12 or 1230, you're not going to sleep well.

41:03.280 --> 41:05.840
Cause there's just a lot of stuff just sitting there, right?

41:05.840 --> 41:07.120
Keeping you awake.

41:07.120 --> 41:10.240
And so for me, it's been this continuous kind of learning.

41:10.960 --> 41:14.960
And we talk about some of these things and, you know, I think in the workforce,

41:14.960 --> 41:16.720
it's, it's a little, it's no different.

41:17.280 --> 41:19.920
Cause then people got to shuttle the kids off to school in the morning

41:19.920 --> 41:20.960
and you got to make breakfast.

41:20.960 --> 41:22.000
You got to do all these things.

41:22.720 --> 41:25.600
So you, you kind of need good sleep at night.

41:26.320 --> 41:28.160
And it starts, I think a lot there.

41:28.160 --> 41:30.640
And then during the day, we need breaks.

41:31.440 --> 41:37.200
People think, uh, and it's in the book that you, that our brain has endless capacity.

41:37.760 --> 41:38.800
It's just not true.

41:38.800 --> 41:40.240
We don't have endless capacity.

41:40.800 --> 41:45.040
You know, our brain, like everything else needs to recharge.

41:45.920 --> 41:50.800
And if you can find ways to recharge, whether it's listening to you every day,

41:51.520 --> 41:54.400
uh, congratulations on over 600 episodes.

41:54.400 --> 42:01.440
We were talking about 50 million streams as our chief purpose officer, which I am so grateful for,

42:01.440 --> 42:07.360
because there are times where those seven minutes from me, where I listen to you,

42:07.360 --> 42:11.760
whether it's in the car, driving my kids, uh, to school takes 10 minutes.

42:12.320 --> 42:14.240
Uh, some days it takes 30 with traffic.

42:15.200 --> 42:18.720
There, there are moments that I just cherish or when I'm driving back alone.

42:19.360 --> 42:24.880
And it's, it just helps me then as I start to recenter myself to be more productive during the

42:24.880 --> 42:30.480
day or during the day, I take a short break and I know how to recharge now, whether it's going

42:30.480 --> 42:32.080
outside, walking or others.

42:32.080 --> 42:38.720
And it makes me so much more productive because what I find is if I work in a manner and I find

42:38.720 --> 42:45.840
myself falling below 50%, 25% of my battery, and I just keep trying to power through my work gets,

42:46.400 --> 42:47.200
it's not very good.

42:48.080 --> 42:49.600
It's embarrassingly bad.

42:49.600 --> 42:53.920
I would say at times and no amount of AI is going to make it better.

42:53.920 --> 42:54.400
Yeah.

42:54.400 --> 42:55.520
You know, it's just not.

42:55.520 --> 42:56.000
Yeah.

42:56.000 --> 43:03.360
And so I then have to kind of take a step back and be like, okay, you're trending in

43:03.360 --> 43:04.160
the wrong direction.

43:04.960 --> 43:05.440
Take a beat.

43:06.080 --> 43:10.320
And I talk about this at a company and with many other companies that are out there today.

43:10.320 --> 43:13.040
And I know so many employees I talk to resonate around this.

43:13.040 --> 43:13.520
Yeah.

43:13.520 --> 43:13.760
Right.

43:13.760 --> 43:15.680
Cause they just feel it's an endless hamster wheel.

43:15.680 --> 43:16.240
For sure.

43:16.240 --> 43:16.560
Right.

43:16.560 --> 43:16.880
Sure.

43:16.880 --> 43:17.120
Yeah.

43:17.120 --> 43:23.040
I was, as you were speaking, I was thinking about how if you have a still mind, you actually

43:23.040 --> 43:31.040
make quicker, better decisions. And if you have a stressed mind, you actually make slower,

43:31.600 --> 43:32.480
worse decisions.

43:32.480 --> 43:33.200
Yeah.

43:33.200 --> 43:37.920
And we think, oh, well, if I take time out to be still, I'll lose time. But actually,

43:37.920 --> 43:40.240
if you take time out to be still, you'll gain time.

43:40.240 --> 43:40.640
Yeah.

43:40.640 --> 43:46.480
Because you'll make better decisions. They'll be more long-term. They won't be rushed and haphazard.

43:46.480 --> 43:51.600
And they'll actually be, you'll be a better communicator. I know for a fact that if I'm stressed,

43:51.600 --> 43:53.680
I don't communicate as clearly. Yeah.

43:53.680 --> 43:59.200
I can, I can be a bit more like rushed and, you know, kind of like, let's hurry this up and short.

43:59.200 --> 43:59.920
Short with people.

43:59.920 --> 44:06.240
Yeah. Whereas if I'm rested and I'm still, then actually I'm able to formulate ideas.

44:06.240 --> 44:10.560
I can be more tolerant. I can be more patient, which are all the skills you need. And so

44:11.120 --> 44:17.200
taking out seven minutes a day doesn't make you slower. It actually makes you faster and better.

44:17.200 --> 44:21.440
And, and something I pulled from your book, these, these stats were really fascinating for me to

44:21.440 --> 44:28.080
read. So 61% of people feel expected to just get over stress.

44:28.080 --> 44:28.480
Yeah.

44:29.600 --> 44:29.920
Yeah.

44:29.920 --> 44:37.520
That's unbelievable that 61% of people feel like they're expected to just get over stress.

44:37.520 --> 44:37.840
Yeah.

44:37.840 --> 44:46.240
It's just, why is that when I was younger and I didn't understand this, uh, when I was 14 years

44:46.240 --> 44:50.160
old and I think it was much younger. I wrote about it in the book that it was 14. I actually think it

44:50.160 --> 44:56.240
happened when I was younger. I just didn't, I just don't recollect those times when I got really

44:56.240 --> 45:01.840
stressed or nervous. And most of the time they're around like tests or speaking stuff or in front of

45:01.840 --> 45:08.080
the class, I just started to get a tightness in my chest. I would, I would get shortness of breath

45:08.080 --> 45:12.880
at times. I would sweat in my hands and I didn't really understand what was happening. And I talked

45:12.880 --> 45:19.040
to my mom, you know, and like a very traditional Korean mother, she'd be like, just power through it.

45:19.040 --> 45:22.640
And I'm like, okay, I'm just going to power through it. Right. But she didn't know either

45:22.640 --> 45:26.880
what was happening. And I don't blame her around that. She just didn't understand in the moment.

45:26.880 --> 45:32.480
You know, the reality is when you think about your mental health, it's not about just do,

45:32.480 --> 45:37.200
you know, and it's not about powering through the moment. It's for me, it's about powering up,

45:38.000 --> 45:41.360
you know, and it's, and that's where the battery analogy keeps coming back in.

45:41.360 --> 45:46.480
Yeah. And, and I didn't understand some of that. And then you cup, and then I didn't have the

45:46.480 --> 45:51.200
vocabulary. It wasn't really until I started getting into healthcare that I started to understand,

45:51.200 --> 45:56.560
oh, wow, this is what you were going through. You've been able to kind of manage it and through

45:56.880 --> 46:01.280
some unhealthy behaviors at times. And now you are doing it through healthy behaviors,

46:02.480 --> 46:07.040
but the vocabulary has changed. Right. And you have a better command of that vocabulary. So you

46:07.040 --> 46:09.680
know how to talk about it now where I didn't know how to talk about it then.

46:09.680 --> 46:16.000
Yeah. And so I do think so much of the, the population today is about powering through it.

46:16.000 --> 46:22.160
And I do think a lot of the population, and I would say more in countries like Korea or Asia,

46:23.040 --> 46:27.360
even though mental health is the most approachable it's ever been, like in the States,

46:28.800 --> 46:34.560
it's not really approachable there, you know, and, and that does make me sad at times when I go back

46:34.560 --> 46:38.480
home, my parents moved back to Korea, they live there. I want to talk about these things with them.

46:38.480 --> 46:43.840
And it's just not, it's not easy for them to talk about. Right. I don't know how it was for you.

46:43.840 --> 46:45.920
Yeah, I know. Did you talk about this when you were a kid with you?

46:45.920 --> 46:49.280
It's so interesting what you were saying about your experiences of stress growing up,

46:49.280 --> 46:53.760
mine were the same and they didn't know what it was either. So I would, it's the same things,

46:53.760 --> 47:00.480
exams, anything high performance related. I'd feel like my chest got tighter. My heart felt like it

47:00.480 --> 47:06.320
wasn't being the same. I'd get, you know, sweaty palms. And I remember going to the doctors and

47:06.320 --> 47:12.240
they'd wire me up with these monitors, like old school monitors, big things. I'd have to wear it for

47:12.240 --> 47:17.600
24 hours. And I'd go back and they'd be like, oh, he's fine. And I'd be like, but mom, I'm not fine.

47:17.600 --> 47:22.240
Like there's something I'm feeling and there was no word for it. And so I can very much relate.

47:22.240 --> 47:25.680
And again, my mom didn't know what it was either. And she was trying her best to help,

47:25.680 --> 47:31.200
but we couldn't figure it out. And so I got on with it and I always have. And then I was thankful

47:31.200 --> 47:37.120
enough to learn mindfulness and meditation many years later that have been my core practices.

47:37.120 --> 47:41.920
And now it's not that I don't get nervous before I'm going on stage or a podcast.

47:42.560 --> 47:47.520
I still do, but I know what to do. And so I have my breath work. I know what I have to lock into.

47:47.520 --> 47:53.120
It's not that I don't experience those emotions anymore, but I agree even in a South Asian family,

47:53.120 --> 48:00.480
like I don't think that vulnerability was normal from parents. It wasn't common for uncles and aunts

48:00.480 --> 48:05.520
to be that way. And so it created a culture of always putting your best foot forward,

48:06.160 --> 48:09.120
always somewhat being performative.

48:09.120 --> 48:09.680
That's right.

48:09.680 --> 48:14.240
And I think I never subscribed to that. So I started very early on rebelling and just

48:14.240 --> 48:14.800
Good for you.

48:14.800 --> 48:15.760
Being myself.

48:15.760 --> 48:18.240
I wish I had done that.

48:18.240 --> 48:22.960
Yeah. And I was just, I'm just, I started breaking the rules early on that and I'm grateful that I

48:22.960 --> 48:29.120
did. But now I realize it wasn't that I was breaking the rules. I was just expressing my

48:29.120 --> 48:36.160
discomfort with having to put up a face or a mask on when everything wasn't okay.

48:36.160 --> 48:36.880
Yeah.

48:36.880 --> 48:43.280
And, and I think that's hard for people to do today, where I read another stat that said 33%

48:43.280 --> 48:47.520
of people feel too overwhelmed by daily stress to think ahead.

48:47.520 --> 48:48.080
Yeah.

48:48.080 --> 48:53.040
Like when you think about that, it's like, gosh, like, you know, that's what people are under.

48:53.040 --> 48:53.520
Mm-hmm.

48:53.520 --> 48:54.400
What are some of the-

48:54.400 --> 48:55.520
I mean, you forget that, right?

48:55.520 --> 48:56.240
You forget that.

48:56.240 --> 49:02.320
You just forget it. I mean, you think about those numbers, that's whether it's two thirds or one third

49:02.880 --> 49:08.320
of all people feeling this way. And you start to realize, well, that's heavy, you know? And

49:08.320 --> 49:12.320
if you were in a room and three out of 10 or six out of 10 are feeling a certain way,

49:12.320 --> 49:17.120
you start to realize there's more. This is why with corporations, I think it's so important

49:17.120 --> 49:18.800
that they can take leadership positions.

49:18.800 --> 49:19.840
Mm-hmm.

49:19.840 --> 49:22.640
Again, I always go back to the top on some of these things, because

49:23.520 --> 49:29.120
if we're not comfortable being vulnerable, and if we're not comfortable making sure that our

49:29.120 --> 49:34.400
HR teams have the tools to talk about this with employees, that we don't support some of these

49:34.400 --> 49:40.320
initiatives, we're kind of in a place where we're saying, oh, we don't believe some of those stats,

49:40.320 --> 49:41.600
but the stats are there and growing.

49:41.600 --> 49:42.240
Mm-hmm.

49:42.240 --> 49:47.040
Right? And, and yes, there's, you know, there's life things that are happening,

49:47.040 --> 49:49.520
but technology is moving so fast on the other side.

49:49.520 --> 49:50.000
Mm-hmm.

49:50.000 --> 49:54.560
Right? I mean, we are definitely in an era right now where kids have grown up with their

49:54.560 --> 50:00.240
smartphones. They act differently than, you know, when I grew up or when you grew up. It's just

50:00.240 --> 50:04.320
different. We, and they grew up with this technology. They're very comfortable with it,

50:04.320 --> 50:09.280
the speed of it, which is coming. And so, and then there's the weight of what's happening just

50:09.280 --> 50:15.360
in life around them. And so some of these things, even at the company level, which are interesting,

50:15.360 --> 50:19.440
and you don't do this is like, and I found this a little bit with myself. I'll just tell you on a

50:19.440 --> 50:25.600
personal front, we're taught to play it very safe. And I think that's an important thing,

50:25.600 --> 50:30.640
too. I'll tell you a lot of people miss is that, you know, you don't want to say the wrong thing.

50:30.640 --> 50:34.080
So you're not going to talk about your own vulnerability because that's not playing it

50:34.080 --> 50:38.960
down the fairway. You kind of want to be boring. I'll be frank with you for a lot of leaders,

50:38.960 --> 50:43.680
not all leaders, which we know there's a couple of them that are quite, but for most leaders,

50:43.680 --> 50:48.880
when you go out there, they're media trained to be right down the fairway.

50:48.880 --> 50:55.600
And what I love when I listen and watch your podcast, it's so authentic. It's so real.

50:56.160 --> 51:02.800
It's so safe for all the people that listen. And then, and it just shows right with how many people

51:02.800 --> 51:07.440
are tuning in every day. Right. And listening to you and doing what I did. It's like, I'll listen

51:07.440 --> 51:10.640
to somebody and then I'll go back to that. I'll be like, Oh, I remembered that I'm going to go back

51:10.640 --> 51:16.720
to that. And it's just because we just play it safe in a lot of places today. And you don't want

51:16.720 --> 51:21.280
to say the wrong thing. Yeah. And I think it's okay. You know, like even if I was here with you

51:21.280 --> 51:27.040
today and maybe something, and I didn't say the right thing today, I'm in a space where I feel so

51:27.040 --> 51:30.960
safe with you right now. I just want to be myself and not everything's going to be perfect.

51:30.960 --> 51:35.600
Absolutely. Right. And, and that's kind of part of life. And I've started to accept that.

51:36.160 --> 51:41.360
And I've become much more vulnerable with my own employees to be like, Hey, this is okay.

51:42.080 --> 51:47.200
And because of that, in the last couple of years, we're stronger, we're stronger as a company.

51:47.920 --> 51:52.160
We just had a board meeting and they're like, wow, this is great. Everyone's like, yes,

51:52.160 --> 51:56.960
we're doing much better. But I think because we're developing and, and really building on the right

51:56.960 --> 52:01.760
culture, we're asking the right questions or, and we want to lead by example. Yeah. Right.

52:01.760 --> 52:07.200
What was something you shared with them that you feel was challenging, uncomfortable that,

52:07.200 --> 52:12.160
that led to that breakthrough? Yeah. I, um, in the last one that you were at,

52:12.160 --> 52:19.360
I did talk about my smoking as a kid. I talked about me being overweight as a child, dealing with

52:19.360 --> 52:27.840
that, that insecurity. Um, I've always had a struggle with food. I love French fries. I'm just gonna,

52:28.560 --> 52:34.960
yeah, I guess I'm telling you, I love ice cream. And I think sometimes, and I have a really,

52:34.960 --> 52:42.080
no matter what I try to do diet wise, I, if you put some fries in front of me, I'm gonna eat them.

52:44.240 --> 52:48.560
Uh, if I, if you put some ice cream in front of me and someone, my kids are having, I'm gonna eat

52:48.560 --> 52:52.640
some of that too. And my kids are like, dad, I thought you're like full. I was like, I was.

52:53.760 --> 52:58.720
All right. So I struggle with that. I know when I'm a little bit stressed, I'm a little bit of a binge

52:58.720 --> 53:04.960
eater as well. I try to obviously develop a lot of healthy habits also around how to be healthier.

53:04.960 --> 53:10.960
And so I do, I do exercise a lot more, but some of those things are hard just to get rid of,

53:10.960 --> 53:15.520
you know, it's, it's more like you're going to have to live with it and it's how you live with it.

53:15.520 --> 53:19.040
That's like that comment about stress. You're never going to have a stress-free workplace,

53:19.040 --> 53:22.880
but you got to figure out how you just have more healthy stress,

53:22.880 --> 53:27.280
right. How you stress rather than distress. Yeah. What's, what's the most common thing

53:27.280 --> 53:31.760
you hear from leaders that they're struggling with in their organizations when it comes to

53:32.480 --> 53:38.240
stress and teams, mental health. I, I think a lot of leaders today struggle with,

53:38.880 --> 53:43.520
as I spoke to you about vulnerability and how you gave the story about vulnerability,

53:44.080 --> 53:47.120
that story plays over, over and over again. Wow.

53:47.120 --> 53:52.240
You know, leaders struggle with how to be vulnerable. And I think it's, I think it's

53:52.880 --> 53:56.320
generational on a personal, I think the new leaders that are going to rise,

53:56.320 --> 54:01.600
the ones in their twenties are going to have no problem. All right. Because when you look at social

54:01.600 --> 54:06.080
media today and a lot of the younger generation, they talk about their mental stress and they talk

54:06.080 --> 54:12.800
about their mental health and they're very open about it. Now, again, they may overuse it or, you know,

54:12.800 --> 54:18.240
but at least they're having a conversation around it. I think, you know, with other leaders today,

54:18.240 --> 54:22.640
when I talk to them, they're just like, Hey, is it a sign of weakness? Like you brought up

54:23.520 --> 54:27.440
in, is it going to be used against me? Yeah. Is someone going to write about it and say,

54:27.440 --> 54:34.560
I'm too weak. Is the board going to think I'm weak as a leader? And I think that is the,

54:34.560 --> 54:40.480
that's ultimately also a fail of corporate stewardship because they have to also look after

54:40.480 --> 54:45.280
your mental health, you know? And so when I'm, you know, I'm fortunate to be on the board of calm

54:45.280 --> 54:53.200
today, but if I wasn't CEO, I would be asking that CEO, Hey, how are you doing? How are you holding

54:53.200 --> 54:58.400
up? Let's not talk about the numbers today. You know, I find it really effective when I meet with

54:58.400 --> 55:04.400
CEOs and they ask for some coaching. We don't talk about any numbers. We don't talk about the metrics.

55:05.040 --> 55:11.680
We just talk about life and we'll eventually go to that later. But I think when we start with more

55:11.680 --> 55:16.880
of a trusting place where we can understand what's happening around you, then I can be much more

55:16.880 --> 55:22.560
thoughtful in the type of advice I give. But this also means I have to create the space and the time

55:22.560 --> 55:27.280
to do it. So not everyone has that. Right. And that's where I think it's just really important to

55:27.280 --> 55:32.000
be really intentional. Yeah. Right. Be really purposeful in these conversations. Yeah. I think one of the

55:32.000 --> 55:38.000
reasons why we struggle to recharge is because when your phone's running out of battery,

55:38.000 --> 55:42.960
there's only one, well, we're also bad at this. There's only meant to be one type of charger.

55:42.960 --> 55:49.600
Now I've seen people charge their phone with their Mac charger, destroying your phone. Right. You'd see

55:49.600 --> 55:55.440
it being charged with the iPad charger. Like, but the point is there's one charger. Yeah. And I think

55:55.440 --> 56:06.080
when it comes to life, sleep is a charger. Meditation and mindfulness. 100%. Food is a charger. Working

56:06.080 --> 56:12.560
out is a charger. And people you love being around good relationships are a charger. And if everyone,

56:12.560 --> 56:19.440
while you're listening to this, if you could figure out the most common times you feel at 1%, 5%,

56:19.440 --> 56:25.520
10%, 20%, and figure out what's the charge you need for that. Well said. Right. Like, that's what

56:25.520 --> 56:30.880
I think we need to do. Like, I'll give an example. I went to an event the other day and I had to fly

56:30.880 --> 56:36.720
out of town and come back into town. I got back at like 4 a.m. And I worked out the next day and I felt

56:36.720 --> 56:43.680
so weak because I hadn't slept well. Of course. And I had eaten well. And so at that point, I'm glad I still

56:43.680 --> 56:48.560
worked out because I needed it. But I told my trainer I had to get a bit of an easier workout because I

56:48.560 --> 56:55.360
didn't want to push myself when I felt weak. But it's like, it takes little adjustments of figuring

56:55.360 --> 57:00.240
out what charge you need right now. Like now, I've had a busy week, had a busy weekend. This weekend,

57:00.240 --> 57:06.240
I know recharge means I need no social plans. Like, that's what's going to recharge me. And so I wish

57:06.240 --> 57:10.160
everyone could just write down while you're listening to this and while you're reading David's book,

57:10.160 --> 57:15.520
Recharge, you write down what are those most common experiences you feel when you feel drained,

57:15.520 --> 57:20.720
when you feel overwhelmed, when you feel burnt out and what is your charger so that you don't have

57:20.720 --> 57:23.520
to think about it in the moment. Because when you're trying to figure it out in the moment,

57:24.080 --> 57:29.280
that's when you get more overwhelmed. Like I know before I go on stage, I always practice breath work.

57:29.280 --> 57:34.640
If I've had a couple of late nights, I know sleep is the only charge that's going to solve it.

57:34.640 --> 57:39.360
Yeah. Speaking of that, because you've talked about certain rituals. Are there

57:39.360 --> 57:44.240
certain things that you do every day, like religion every day that you just do?

57:44.240 --> 57:50.160
Yeah, I kind of do what I call like, what I feel is like a good 80-20. So like, I know five days

57:50.160 --> 57:57.360
out of the seven days a week, I'm working out. Five days out of seven, I'm meditating before 9am.

57:58.000 --> 58:03.120
And then the other two will be meditating after 9am. And I like that balance that I have.

58:03.840 --> 58:06.320
Gratitude is something I'm practicing every single day.

58:06.320 --> 58:11.840
Yeah, it's such an important one. I think we do something with my team that I love. Every

58:12.400 --> 58:17.440
Friday, we'll do a weekly win. And everyone's encouraged to share what they believe is their

58:17.440 --> 58:23.520
win. And sometimes what's amazing about this activity is you feel it will always be like,

58:23.520 --> 58:29.920
oh, we had so-and-so on the podcast, or we won so-and-so award or, and it isn't. It's actually

58:29.920 --> 58:35.680
these little things that people are doing behind the scenes that are not like these grand wins

58:35.680 --> 58:40.720
externally. And they believe that that's been their success. And I think it's a really great

58:40.720 --> 58:45.200
way to actually get to know each other because you get to see what people value as success.

58:45.200 --> 58:45.920
Yeah, 100%.

58:45.920 --> 58:50.800
And you get to understand what people see as value in the work they do. Whereas we just assume that,

58:50.800 --> 58:54.560
of course, if there's a big quarter, then everyone should be excited. And it's like,

58:54.560 --> 58:55.440
well, maybe not.

58:55.440 --> 58:55.840
Right.

58:55.840 --> 59:01.360
Because that's not what they equate as their personal success and contribution. And so

59:01.360 --> 59:04.640
doing the weekly wins on Friday is one of my favorite things to do with my team.

59:04.640 --> 59:05.200
I love that.

59:05.200 --> 59:06.800
It takes like 30 minutes to do.

59:06.800 --> 59:07.360
Yeah.

59:07.360 --> 59:10.960
And everyone just goes around my core team and just shares what was their weekly win.

59:10.960 --> 59:11.120
Yeah.

59:11.120 --> 59:11.600
It's huge.

59:11.600 --> 59:16.320
I love that. I sometimes start my beginning of the week staff meetings with like, how was your

59:16.320 --> 59:21.680
weekend? Just tell us something that happened personal. You know, I also find sometimes we get into

59:21.680 --> 59:25.840
all the details without getting to know one another. Yeah. You know, and I find a lot,

59:26.880 --> 59:31.280
a lot of times teams don't work well. They can work better together when they're a little bit

59:31.280 --> 59:35.120
more personal with one another. And it may, it doesn't have to be deep. It could just be like,

59:35.120 --> 59:39.600
hey, what did you do? Some people will say, I went on a hike. I, you know, went to my kid's game

59:39.600 --> 59:44.960
or, you know, I went, I traveled somewhere or binge watched a show and we're all like, what show?

59:44.960 --> 59:48.560
What's your favorite show or something? And we just get to learn something a little bit more

59:48.560 --> 59:54.960
personal about the individual. And then it's less about, oh, did you hand in that PRD or something?

59:54.960 --> 59:57.200
Right. It's just, it's more personal. Yeah.

59:57.200 --> 01:00:02.800
And I think, and by you just doing your wins every week, you know, how I just, I love that.

01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:08.000
Yeah. I think about it as very simple. I think about it like this, like you're going to spend

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:09.920
a third of your life at work. Yeah.

01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:12.880
Learn to get along with your colleagues. Yeah.

01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:18.160
Learn to build relationships with the people you spend nine hours a day with.

01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:22.960
You're going to spend a third of your life with these people. You should actually really get

01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:27.520
to know them. You should be able to laugh with them. It would be wonderful if you could open your

01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:32.960
heart with them. When we kind of go, well, work's this thing over here and I save all of that for

01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:39.360
home. You're basically saying that 30% of your life, you'll never experience joy. You'll never

01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:44.080
experience connection. And I don't think that's the world we want anymore. I think we need a world

01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:48.240
where work can be meaningful and thoughtful and purposeful. And again, going back to what you

01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:51.200
said, it's not that it will ever be stress free. That's right.

01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:55.920
It's not that it's ever going to be perfect or this utopia or this beautiful place where

01:00:55.920 --> 01:01:01.280
everything's amazing. But I think one of the things we don't realize is that a lack of productivity

01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:03.360
stems from a lack of trust. Yeah.

01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:08.960
When you have trust and you have interpersonal connection, things move faster. People are not

01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:14.720
gatekeeping. No one's trying to be a bottleneck. No one's looking out for how they can be top dog.

01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:17.360
There's this feeling of we're all going to win together. And I think

01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:24.400
if leaders can start to figure out what that culture is, then people will achieve so much more

01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:29.840
and they'll be happier. I think, you know, one of my, I would hate to be at the top of a hill with the

01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:34.720
team and three people like gave up along the way. Two people told me they never want to come back.

01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:35.440
That's right.

01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:40.400
It's in it. I was, I was going to ask you, you've had so much business success before Calm, you're

01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:46.400
now at Calm. Like walk us through how your views have changed of recharging and recharging your team.

01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:50.160
It's, it's, it's actually really interesting. I used to be one of the youngest execs in the room,

01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:55.840
and now I'm the oldest person in the room. I think when I was younger,

01:01:55.840 --> 01:02:03.120
I felt that I had to be in every decision process. And that's a little bit of like,

01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:08.320
oh, I'm productive because I got my hands in everything. And it was probably the opposite.

01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:13.280
I was probably causing more stress and less productivity on a person. And I realized that

01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:20.160
later that it's, it's not the number of meetings or decisions you're making. It's not the quantity.

01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:24.240
It's the quality of those decisions. And I keep going back always the quality of decision making.

01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:26.800
What is a quality decision? Let's, let's define that.

01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:27.920
Yeah, that's great. Yeah.

01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:33.360
So like it's, it's things that you feel that where you sit could move the, for me,

01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:37.840
could move the business forward in the most meaningful manner. So sometimes it could be

01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:42.720
helping teams unlock a product decision. Sometimes it could be helping teams with

01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:48.560
things that partnerships that may move it forward. Other times it may mean things around culture or HR,

01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:53.040
but it's really being intentional in terms of the types of decisions you're making and where

01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:58.480
you're spending your time. It's not being in every decision with everybody because ultimately

01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:05.360
they have to make decisions too. One thing we've been doing now that I feel that has really brought

01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:11.280
the company closer together is, uh, we did this retreat where it wasn't just a leadership team.

01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:16.320
We brought many different people together. And I said, you guys come up with the company strategy.

01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:22.960
And they were like, and this woman, uh, they were like, what? And I'm like, they're like, don't you

01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:29.440
have it? My younger self would have been like, here it is. I was like, no, you do it. And I'll tell

01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:36.880
you, it was so much better than what I was thinking. And it just reminded me again, you hire all these

01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:42.800
smart people. You take all these time vetting them, doing reference checks, let them do their job.

01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:49.040
Give them a chance. If it was a sports analogy to shoot the ball, give them a chance to play.

01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:53.920
You know, don't feel like you're keeping them on the bench the whole time and you have to do

01:03:53.920 --> 01:04:00.960
everything and give them a shot. And I, I do that a lot more now. I'm much more intentional with it.

01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:06.320
Now. It was great. We rolled it out to the company at that offsite you were at. People came away and said

01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:11.680
it was the most inspiring offsite. And they were like, that was great. I said, I didn't do it.

01:04:11.680 --> 01:04:17.920
They did it. It came from the team. And I think it felt so much more meaningful to them because it

01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:23.280
came from them and it was so much more spot on. And we, and, and really what it was around was

01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:27.920
we've talked about trying to make the world healthier and happier. We've tried, we've talked

01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:31.680
about as a company, trying to be with you every step of the way in your mental health journey.

01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:36.080
And this was really around how to become, how do we become the most impactful

01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:42.160
consumer mental health company in the world? And when I sat back and said,

01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:48.240
that's what we want to become. And the team had kind of been the one synthesizing it.

01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:53.760
Then everyone started mobilizing against it on their own. And I, and I, and they had thought

01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:58.640
about things that I had never even thought about because I'm just too far sometimes away from the

01:04:58.640 --> 01:05:06.640
details. And then now I've, I've seen us accelerate and I know that motion and muscle can be repeated.

01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:10.000
Right. And you can bring it to other companies, regardless of size.

01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:14.320
And I think sometimes as companies get larger and I've had the fortune of starting my own company

01:05:14.320 --> 01:05:19.520
where it's like three of us, and then it grows to 30, whatever, 300 and then to thousands.

01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:24.640
And then I've had the fortune of joining companies later where it's thousands and it becomes hundreds of

01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:31.760
thousands. Ultimately that culture is your bedrock, you know, whether or not how many people you stack

01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:36.800
on top of it, what you start to set as your foundation will percolate amongst the entire company.

01:05:37.760 --> 01:05:42.880
And if you don't do that the right way, and if you're not thought, then you may not get the results

01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:47.440
that you're happy with. Right. And you may create more stressful environments that you just unintentionally

01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:53.040
didn't think about. And that's where I really appreciate about when leaders come around,

01:05:53.040 --> 01:05:57.040
they talk about being more thoughtful in their decision-making process, being more vulnerable,

01:05:57.040 --> 01:06:02.720
being more open, really thinking about employees' mental health, but then not just talking about it,

01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:04.960
but then really acting upon it. Totally.

01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:11.120
And if you can do that a little bit year after year, right, you can really create a special culture.

01:06:11.120 --> 01:06:15.920
And I think they'll do special things. Absolutely. David, it's been such a joy talking to you

01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:21.760
today. I really enjoyed our dialogue around recharging and, you know, I'm so grateful for

01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:29.920
the work you're doing at Calm because I remember being an analyst at Accenture and I was tasked...

01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:33.360
I'm sure you were really good. I was okay. I was tasked with

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:39.200
teaching meditation in my spare time and mindfulness in my spare time at the company. And I would travel

01:06:39.200 --> 01:06:45.280
around and I would do lunchtime sessions and after work sessions and I couldn't scale myself.

01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:51.360
But now thanks to Calm, not only am I able to scale myself to more people, but we're able to

01:06:51.360 --> 01:06:57.280
introduce people to so many amazing hosts and narrators that we have on Calm. And I think inside

01:06:57.280 --> 01:07:02.640
an organization, you no longer need someone running around the organization physically,

01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:07.040
trying to serve lots of people. You actually have the ability for everyone to tune in.

01:07:07.760 --> 01:07:13.360
And we end every On Purpose episode with a final five. These questions have to be answered in one

01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:19.760
word to one sentence maximum. So David Koh, these are your final five. The first question is,

01:07:19.760 --> 01:07:24.000
what is the best recharge advice you've ever heard in your life?

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:33.440
To be more present. I recognize at times that I've been there, but not really. And so you are,

01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:38.560
you do so good at this where you're just so present, whether it's one person or hundreds or thousands,

01:07:38.560 --> 01:07:43.600
I've seen it. I've been in your auditoriums where you've traveled and everyone feels your presence.

01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:44.960
And so presence.

01:07:44.960 --> 01:07:50.400
I like that answer. Not the part about me, you're very kind, but the, uh, because I don't think we

01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:55.440
realize how draining it is when you're not present. And you gave that great analogy earlier, when you

01:07:55.440 --> 01:08:01.760
have lots of tabs and apps open, that's when we drain our battery. And so so many of us are draining our

01:08:01.760 --> 01:08:05.520
battery by thinking, oh, I'm here right now with David, but actually if my mind's over there,

01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:09.600
I'll get more done. And you're actually depleting your battery. So it's a great answer.

01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:15.360
Uh, second question. What is the worst advice you've ever heard about recharging yourself?

01:08:17.280 --> 01:08:22.480
Sorry, mom. Cause she's going to be listening and watching. Uh, and my mom, I love my mom. So

01:08:22.480 --> 01:08:26.640
I'm going to start by that. And she's giving me lots of great advice, but this probably was the

01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:32.400
worst advice she gave me as a child, which was to power through. And it's not about powering through.

01:08:32.400 --> 01:08:38.160
It's really about powering up and she didn't know, you know, but you know, mom, I think it was not

01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:42.800
about powering through. Question number three, what's your three favorite ways to power up?

01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:50.400
So I have rituals like you and my rituals in the morning. Uh, when I wake up, I don't look at my

01:08:50.400 --> 01:08:58.080
phone right away. I actually go downstairs. I start the coffee. I open the window and, uh, I walk

01:08:58.080 --> 01:09:03.440
outside and I take three breaths. And it's been something I've been very intentional about doing.

01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:07.520
If I'm traveling, I try to open the window, you know, wherever it may be, if you're an apartment or

01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:16.080
something, that process starts to center me. The second I do is I do a lot of walking meetings.

01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:21.600
And so I'm a big fan of like trying to break things up that helped me reach her. So people

01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:27.440
give me energy. I would say going outside, breathing people give me energy. And then lastly,

01:09:27.440 --> 01:09:33.280
I think similar to yourself, I love to exercise as well. And I've become a lot better at keeping a

01:09:33.280 --> 01:09:37.760
steady schedule around it. And even someone said this to me the other day, they said, do something

01:09:37.760 --> 01:09:43.520
every day. Right. And, and I'm like, great. I'm gonna do something every day. And I'm gonna be

01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:48.640
really intentional about it and just keep at it. Uh, some days I'll go to the gym. Sometimes I'll do

01:09:48.640 --> 01:09:53.680
something at home. It'd be really quick. Um, but exercise as well. I love that. Question number four,

01:09:53.680 --> 01:10:00.400
what are your three favorite ways to power down? I turn everything off, meaning the following.

01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:05.600
So it won't be just putting my phone and turning it over. Cause I don't think sometimes that's enough.

01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:12.080
I'll just be like, you know what? I'm kind of done. I wanted to ask you earlier, because I'm curious

01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:18.880
if you had a day and you didn't use your phone, social media, what does that day look like for you?

01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:25.040
Those are the best days. It doesn't happen very often. I've definitely tried really hard. One

01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:28.720
thing I've really focused on is when me and my wife are together in the evening for dinner. And

01:10:28.720 --> 01:10:33.280
then if we are watching a show or something is not bringing the phone to those two things,

01:10:33.280 --> 01:10:37.360
because I found myself a lot of the time, like finishing off last emails, messaging while we're

01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:42.000
having dinner. And then when you're watching a show, you're distracted. And then you watch your

01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:47.440
partner get distracted. And then you're like mad at them for getting distracted. But then when they

01:10:47.440 --> 01:10:50.480
put their phone down, you've got yours up and they're mad at you for getting distracted. And

01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:55.120
I was like, what are we doing here? And I was starting to notice just my attention span just

01:10:55.760 --> 01:11:02.320
dropping. I've noticed that a lot in the last 12 months, more than any time before. And I've

01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:07.200
realized so much of it is because of just the speed of consumption. So now it's not even that we're

01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:13.680
consuming a lot. We're consuming a lot at a really fast rate. And so you're just making it easier for

01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:20.800
your mind to get two seconds of everything. And so for me, I try and make my weekends very phone

01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:26.960
free because weekdays I am on my phone. I've also found that even when I'm with my team, if I can

01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:31.920
have my laptop in the room, but my laptop's not connected to messaging apps, and then my phone's

01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:36.960
not in the room, I actually find I'm better with my team. So I can still do email. I can still do work

01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:42.400
on my laptop, but it's not wired up to WhatsApp. It's not wired up to text message. I don't need

01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:47.520
it. And so I've been trying to leave my phone actually out of my hand when I'm not traveling.

01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:53.040
If I'm going out for work or driving, of course I need my phone. But if I'm in the office, I don't

01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:58.960
need my phone on me in meetings or in between meetings actually. And all of this is stuff I'm

01:11:58.960 --> 01:12:03.600
still working on too, because I find myself go through ups and downs with it. There are times when

01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:08.000
I'm brilliant at it. I also follow you. I don't keep my phone in my bedroom. Don't look at it

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:12.880
first thing in the morning. But I also have days where I break that completely when I'm traveling.

01:12:12.880 --> 01:12:18.640
And so I don't want to make anyone feel like I've got it down or perfect because I haven't.

01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:22.960
And I think it's almost like peaks and troughs. There's always a good day and a bad week and

01:12:22.960 --> 01:12:25.600
a good week and a bad day. Yeah. Yeah. That's great. That's brilliant.

01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:26.880
I love that. Just being honest. Yeah.

01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:32.720
Fifth and final question to David Coe. If you could create one law that everyone in the world had to

01:12:32.720 --> 01:12:38.720
follow, what would it be? Kids have to go to gym five days and they know there's physical exercise.

01:12:38.720 --> 01:12:44.400
And it's just kind of like, it's just understood. Why can't we take some of that time for children

01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:49.200
to also better understand their own mental health and to teach them about their mental health?

01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:53.280
Because we know so much of this starts early, just like it started with myself at 14.

01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:59.360
If I had that vocabulary at 14, I probably would have developed better kind of healthy behaviors at 14

01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:04.960
and did that as I turned into a young adult. So I would love to take a little bit of time.

01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:09.120
It doesn't have to be all the time. It could be carve outs, maybe once, twice, three times a week,

01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:14.960
where we educate our children and check up on them on their mental health or their battery and ask

01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:19.200
them the question. I love that. What a great law. That would have a big impact on the world.

01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:24.880
The book is called Recharge. We've got interviews with everyone from Randall Park to Macklemore.

01:13:24.880 --> 01:13:30.400
It's a brilliant book. So fascinating. I love the format. I love the format. The format's

01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:36.720
fantastic. Like you sat down with experts, with rappers, with rebels, innovators, thought leaders,

01:13:36.720 --> 01:13:41.040
and you put together this beautiful book called Recharge. David, I'm so grateful that you put it

01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:44.880
together. I'm so grateful we connected. Yeah. And thank you for taking the time,

01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:50.720
having me here. Thank you for talking about the book. It's something I'm so proud of. I hope

01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:55.200
people, people get some, you know, really get something out of it. We talked to a lot of

01:13:55.200 --> 01:14:00.640
different folks, like you said, uh, like Randall, who's, you know, you know as well, and many other

01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:07.760
folks there, uh, Delilah, and they just talked about so many amazing things. And I, um, I was really

01:14:07.760 --> 01:14:12.960
touched by talking to each and every one of them. I was honored to hear their stories and it just made

01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:17.360
me a better person. It also has helped me in my mental health journey, and I hope it helps some other

01:14:17.360 --> 01:14:20.960
people as well. David, thank you so much. Is there anything I didn't ask you that you really

01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:25.040
want to touch on something that's on your heart or mind that's calling for you to share? I'd love

01:14:25.040 --> 01:14:31.200
for you to share it. You never asked me how my battery is. How's your battery? I would tell you

01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:35.760
my battery is at a hundred, over a hundred percent, because I got to spend time with you.

01:14:35.760 --> 01:14:42.800
Oh, you're too kind. No, no. And I'll tell you, conversations like this just recharge and energize me.

01:14:43.440 --> 01:14:47.840
I love the fact that we got to sit. I love the fact that I got to know you personally and

01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:53.520
professionally. I'm so grateful for our friendship, your mentorship, your words of wisdom. I know how

01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:59.600
many millions of people you affect every day. I mean, over 50 million people, the entire employee

01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:07.200
base of calm, uh, really just, uh, I can't tell you the impact you've made both, uh, on us on a

01:15:07.200 --> 01:15:10.640
personal and professional front. So thank you. I want to ask you, how's your battery?

01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:14.800
Do you know what? And I'm not just saying this because you're here and I, and I really do mean

01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:20.880
it. You've recharged my battery too. Like this conversation is, I'd say before you came in today,

01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:23.280
I was probably at like a 60. Yeah.

01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:27.440
Yeah. I've had a lot of social events in the past couple of weeks. Just we had Diwali,

01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:33.040
which is our beautiful festival every year. We had, there was just so much going on and all good

01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:35.040
stuff, all stuff I wanted to go to. Yeah.

01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:41.360
Yeah. But I'm very disciplined about my sleep all year round. And at this time of year, I kind of let

01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:46.560
go a little bit because there are so many wonderful events that I get invited to. And so I've been

01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:53.280
feeling a bit, and as soon as you came in, you took me from a 60 to a 95 easily. And honestly,

01:15:53.280 --> 01:15:58.560
it's this conversation because it felt so real, so authentic, so genuine. I felt like, again, you were

01:15:58.560 --> 01:16:02.720
really present. And I think that's what we don't realize when you're present with someone, you're charging

01:16:02.720 --> 01:16:10.080
them up while you're being charged. And that's such a superpower that often we think, oh, if I'm

01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:15.360
charging someone else off, I'm losing energy. But that's not true. If you're charging someone else

01:16:15.360 --> 01:16:21.040
up by being present, you're getting charged up and so are they. And we've both felt that today.

01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:28.240
And I genuinely felt that today. And honestly, Calm has just been such a brilliant partner. It's the

01:16:28.240 --> 01:16:33.040
team I love working with every day, whether it's the content team, the team that we work with in

01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:39.200
the studio, the team that I get to see once a year, the leadership. Everyone walks the talk there.

01:16:39.200 --> 01:16:44.960
And it's so impressive to me. Thank you. Because I felt it from the moment I started doing Zooms and

01:16:44.960 --> 01:16:49.680
meetings with everyone at Calm. And it's remarkable what you're all doing. And I can't wait to be a part

01:16:49.680 --> 01:16:54.880
of the future. So congratulations. And it's just the beginning. I think we're just getting started.

01:16:54.880 --> 01:16:58.160
I appreciate it. Thank you, Jay. Thank you, David. Thanks for having me on again. Thank you so much.

01:16:58.800 --> 01:17:04.320
If this year you're trying to live longer, live happier, live healthier, go and check out my

01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:11.040
conversation with the world's biggest longevity doctor, Peter Attia, on how to slow down aging and

01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:15.760
why your emotional health is directly impacting your physical health.

01:17:15.760 --> 01:17:21.520
Acknowledge that there is surprisingly little known about the relationship between nutrition

01:17:21.520 --> 01:17:25.120
and health. And people are going to be shocked to hear that because I think most people think the

01:17:25.120 --> 01:17:34.880
exact opposite.

01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:36.880
You
