FOREWORD 
 
 
 
The book “An Introduction to Education” is a set of strategies and 
materials in education, developed to assist teachers in guiding their 
classroom and students in understanding fundamental subjects of teaching. 
Introduction to education means to ensure the highest levels of academic 
achievement for all students and it helps students develop a positive self-
concept by providing knowledge about various dimensions of teaching. 
Introduction to Education which includes the contributions of academics 
and researchers aims to provide highest academic achievement in teacher 
education. The book concludes eight chapters: Fundamental Concepts of 
Education, Teachers and Teaching, Social Foundation of Education, 
Philosophy and Educational Philosophy, Psychology and Educational 
Psychology, Foundation of Educational Politics, Comparative Educational 
Systems, and Sociocultural Perspectives: An Opportunity To Understand 
Science Education in a Different Dimension.  
The first chapter is dedicated to the Fundamental Concepts of 
Education. Hasan ARSLAN underlines the concepts of education in 
teacher education. The author gives theoretical perspectives and descriptions 
in education and states that education is a process that begins at birth and 
continues till the end of life. The early stage of life is very crucial since 
this period affects the following process. However, we are not able to 
totally control the early stage because children remain under the care of 
their families until they begin attending school. Even if children study in 
schools, many factors such as friends in and out of the school affect their 
educational process. 
The second chapter deals with Teachers and Teaching. Alina 
Andreea DRAGOESCU focuses on all aspects related to learning and puts 
forward a critical enquiry regarding what confers value upon the 
educational experience. The discussion emphasises language learning, as 
well as the basic factors which affect learning in general – learner 
motivation, language acquisition, and other processes related to cognition 
– from the standpoint of cognitive learning theories.  
The third chapter examines Social Foundation of Education. In this 
chapter, Mehmeet Ali ICBAY first defines the two disciplines, education 
and sociology, and then talks about what research the sociology of 
education does. After that, he presents a brief history of the theoretical 

Foreword

framework. Starting with the classical works by Durkheim and Weber in 
the sociology of education, the chapter continues with the three turning 
points after the Second World War. 
The fourth chapter is dedicated to Philosophy and Educational 
Philosophy: Theoretical-Practical Considerations. Tomas BUTVILAS, 
Eva KRÁLOVÁ and Kęstutis TRAKŠELYS present theoretical and 
application. In the theoretical part, the authors mainly focus on existing 
philosophical schools of education while presenting six approaches that 
are still in use all over the world in classrooms in schools and auditoriums at 
higher education institutions. On the other hand, the presented educational 
philosophies give some basis for describing real educational activities with 
children and adults in both country cases. 
Another chapter on Psychology and Educational Psychology by 
Mirela SAMFIRA argues why is psychology important in the field of 
education? While the question is a simple one, the answer is much more 
complex. Information in the field of psychology is extremely important in 
almost all human fields where humans exist. The goal of this chapter is not 
to debate the role and importance of psychology in humans’ life, but to 
emphasise its applications in the field of education. 
The sixth chapter draws attention on Foundation of Educational 
Politics. Ferda BEYTEKİN provides a historical, philosophical, political, 
and sociological reflection on the relationship connecting education with 
sociology, culture, anthropology, politics, and economics. Education 
policy refers to the collection of laws and rules that govern the operation 
of education systems. 
The seventh chapter focuses on Comparative Educational Systems. 
Sari HOSOYA states that an educational system is political to some 
extent. When the objectives of education behind the educational system 
are suitable for the social environment and the needs of the people, the 
system functions quite well. On the other hand, if it does not match the 
needs, it does not work effectively. The government is required to balance 
the aims of the educational system and the needs of the people thoughtfully. 
The last chapter is written by S. L. Ramos-de ROBLES and A. J. Gallard 
MARTİNEZ. The authors draw attention on Sociocultural Perspectives: An 
Opportunity To Understand Science Education In A Different 
Dimension. The authors suggest that in the science education community 
in terms of ranking of importance, research into the social and cultural 
aspects of teaching and learning is second to the cognitivist who seems to 
mainly use positivism as a way make sense of data.

CHAPTER ONE 
FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS OF EDUCATION 
HASAN ARSLAN 
 
 
 
Education is a process that begins at birth and continues until the end 
of life. The early stage of life is very crucial since this period affects the 
following process. However, we are not able to totally control the early 
stage because children remain under the care of their families until they 
begin attending school. Even if children study in schools, many factors 
such as friends in and out of the school affect their educational process. 
The educational system focuses on children from pre-school until 
graduate education. Educational gains mainly shift from public to 
individual gains as they attend a higher level of school each year. That is 
why education is compulsory in the first 10 or 12 years for children. 
Otherwise, greater and more costly social problems would occur if we 
could not educate them to be good citizens. 
Durkheim (1956) states that "education is the influence exercised by 
adult generations on those that are not yet ready for social life" (p.71). In 
other words, the primary objective of education is to help children develop 
intellectual skills and improve their physical capabilities. Additionally, 
they should be motivated at school to acquire the moral values that are 
demanded by political society, because society may suffer some social 
problems and pay more to fix them if we do not help children achieve 
these objectives. 
Dewey (1897) believes that education functions properly when there is 
a relationship between the individual and the environment, and that the 
purpose of education is to live for today, not to prepare students for future 
living. Thus, firstly moral training should be offered and schools should 
serve "as a form of community". Additionally, education is not a part of 
life and it should be regarded as "a continuing reconstruction of 
experience". If children gain experiences at school, then they may be able 
to learn about real life and become prepared for the future. Therefore, 
"what kind of experiences will they gain?" and "how should we help them 

Chapter One 
 
2
acquire these experiences?" are the questions that should be answered. 
Specialists study curricula in terms of grades and subjects in order to help 
children develop the expected behaviours to have a better society.  
Moore (2010) explains education in relation to the commitment by 
society to have a desirable type of individual and the expected values. 
Thus, children may have some expected characteristics, attitudes, 
knowledge and skills that society would like to see. The author states that 
an educated man should have the desired intellectual abilities and at the 
same time should be very sensitive about moral matters, mathematical 
efficiencies and have a scientific vision and a historical and geographical 
perspective. When we look at society, it seems that the educational system 
has not been successful in training the expected educated man. 
Russel (1926) explains that education should provide children with a 
guide to allow them to develop their capabilities and skills. An education 
system should offer children, be they boys or girls, the opportunity to 
receive the highest level of education. Furthermore, Durkheim (1956) 
underlines that the focus and primary function of education is to prepare 
children for their roles as workers and members of a larger society and 
identifies the purpose of education as the shaping of the social being. 
Formal and Non-Formal Education 
Education can be divided into two categories: formal education and 
non-formal education. There is no certain line to distinguish one from the 
other because formal education to some extent consists of non-formal 
education. Children learn not only at the classroom but also from each 
other at the school environment. 
Formal Education 
Formal education (Ngaka, Openjuru and Mazur 2012) denotes a 
"hierarchically structured and chronologically graded educational system", 
which starts at pre-school and continues through university and includes 
"academic studies, a variety of specialized programs and institutions for 
full-time technical and professional training" (p. 110). 
Children, families, and adults voluntarily participate in formal 
education because they believe that formal education will provide a 
certificate or diploma for their children, and these official documents will 
help them receive a higher level of education and to build a better 
professional career. If unemployment is high and there is high competition 
for employment, then there will be a higher demand for formal education. 

Fundamental Concepts of Education

It might be speculated that governments are pleased to see that people 
demand more formal education and people to see that they get better 
employment opportunities at the end of formal education. Contrarily, if 
people cannot get better opportunities and positions when they graduate, 
they may lose their desire to continue with and participate in formal 
education. This may cause crucial problems in society. 
Non-Formal Education 
Non-formal education (Ngaka, Openjuru and Mazur 2012) refers to 
that type of education which does not take place in formally structured 
schools "such as adult literacy and continuing education programs for 
adults and out of school youth which does not necessarily emphasize 
certification" (p. 111). 
Non-formal education may cause children to develop desirable or 
undesirable behaviours. The environment plays a crucial part in this point. 
Even if it is impossible to monitor students out of school, parents should 
know where their children play and with whom they spend time. On the 
other hand, children may develop some unexpected behaviours even in a 
formally organized school while playing with friends at breaks (MoNE of 
Turkey 2016). 
Non-Formal Education: Non-formal education is intended for citizens 
who have never entered the formal educational system to develop their 
skills, e.g. in order to have a better professional career. Additionally, non-
formal education may accompany formal education and may appear in 
many different forms. For example, improving reading and writing skills 
of citizens, professional development in a specific field, learning about a 
healthy life style, teaching socialization processes to immigrants and 
acquiring the habit of spending time productively is non-formal education. 
  
The differences between formal and non-formal education can be seen 
in terms of the purpose, timing, content, delivery system and level of 
control (p.111).

Learning, Teaching and the Teacher 
What is a "learning experience"? Nyagah (2010) expresses that learning 
refers to the encountering interaction between the external conditions and 
the learner in the environment. Students have various interactions and are 
involved in some activities where learning takes place (UNESCO-IBE 
2013). 
Learning: What is learning? How do we learn? Learning is not only a 
complex process, but also some kind of a long-term psychosocial process. 
Learning includes individual acquisition of competencies, behaviours, 
skills, values, and knowledge. Children acquire these attributes though 
instruction or experience. The learning process is explained with 
psychological and physiological approaches. The learning process can be 
described with three important models. These models are behaviourism, 
cognitivism, and constructivism. Briefly, behaviourism underlines a 

Fundamental Concepts of Education 
 
5 
measurable change of behaviours in the learning process. Environmental 
factors are very important for children and affect their behaviours. 
Cognitive theories focus on the internal mental structure of the knowledge 
that shapes children’s behaviours. Acquisition of knowledge and the 
processing of information happen through internal mental organization. 
The last model is constructivism which views the learning process as the 
addition of concepts and new ideas to existing knowledge and experiences 
(Kridel 2010).  
These learning theories highlight the changes in knowledge, understanding, 
skills, competencies and behaviours through environmental factors, 
internal mental actions or construction of new ideas. Learning is to feel 
different and to motivate individuals to explore new knowledge and ideas.  
Teaching: "There are diverse approaches to teaching which also 
implicitly reflect the approach to learning. The didactic approach mainly 
entails lecturing and is typically teacher-centred and content-oriented, i.e. 
teaching as transmission where the learners are considered to be passive 
recipients of information transmitted. Teaching can also be seen as supporting 
the process of learners’ knowledge construction and understanding, building 
on what is already known by the learner and involving a learner-centred 
approach (i.e. teaching as facilitation). Another approach emphasizes the 
development of learners’ cognitive processes and awareness and control of 
thinking and learning" (UNESCO-UNICEF 2014: 222). 
Teaching as a Profession 
Teaching is a professional job. Individuals spend most of their time in 
teaching activities either at school or at home. Teaching is a full-time job 
even if they spend 4-6 hours at school because teachers make preparations 
before going in class, evaluate students’ performances, assess exam papers 
and so on. Teaching covers all educational activities and teachers are 
responsible for children’s education. Teachers manage the teaching 
process and provide students information, knowledge and skills, and they 
teach students how to attain information, knowledge, and skills (Kadı, 
Beytekin and Arslan, 2015). They direct students’ activities over class 
time (Nyagah 2010). All educational systems focus on the importance of 
teaching. The question is how we can offer good teaching in class. This 
question reminds us of teacher education programs and the quality of 
education. Who can be a teacher? What kind of skills should be taught to 
them?  
According to Nyagah (2010), the following qualities make a good 
teacher: 

Chapter One 
 
6
-  spending most of his/her time with students, 
-  increasing their skills by learning new ideas continuously 
increasing their knowledge, 
-  being a good model for students and conducting their personal life 
with good character, 
-  having appropriate and adequate knowledge of his/her specialization, 
-  adapting to new circumstances and managing crises successfully at 
school. 
 
Durkheim (1956) describes a teacher as "the interpreter of the great 
moral ideas of his time and of his country" (p. 89). Teachers should have  
willpower and demonstrate confidence in their authority to transmit 
information. A teacher should be able to establish his authority without an 
external influence. 
In relation to the quality of teachers and teacher programs, Motivans, 
Smith and Bruneforth (2006) state that specific training is very important 
in teacher education if we desire to offer a good quality of education to 
students. Teacher quality requires "a range of motivation, competencies, 
and skills" (p. 49). 
In consideration of teaching as a profession, a teacher training program 
should include at least three aspects: general studies, subject-specific 
knowledge and pedagogical knowledge. Additionally, holding a knowledge 
of psychology, sociology, educational psychology, educational administration, 
curriculum knowledge, the education system, educational history, 
motivation theories, class management and school administration helps 
preservice teachers be "good" teachers. Preservice teachers need these 
various skills to develop themselves in order to answer students’ different 
questions because students ask questions not only in a teacher’s field but 
also in different subjects. That is why teacher training programs are very 
important to train individuals to be "good" teachers. 
Curriculum 
The term ‘curriculum’ comes from the Latin word ‘curere’ that means 
"to run a course". Therefore, the word denotes a subject which should have 
some special goals and produce outputs for learners. There are various 
kinds of courses in varying scopes. If there is a formal course, there should 
be a curriculum, too. Formal education cannot be established without a 
structured curriculum. There are different types of curricula and different 
types of descriptions in a curriculum (Nyagah 2010). The definitions of 
curriculum can be grouped into two: narrow definition and broad 

Fundamental Concepts of Education 
 
7 
definition. The narrow definition of curriculum is a plan and program. 
Learners follow a course and by the end of the course they have learned 
what the course is supposed to teach. The other definition is a broad one 
which sees curriculum as an educational process. This is a more 
comprehensive and longer process. The course reflects learners' social 
needs. The broader concepts consist of behaviours, values, attitudes, and 
experiences of students both in and out of school. Pratt (1994) states that 
the broad definition looks like a blueprint for instruction and incorporates 
teaching and learning processes. 
Curriculum describes each detail of teaching and learning process and 
attempts to answer what, why, and how questions. A good curriculum 
fosters quality of learning in schools. This is a systematic and intentional 
way to have expected results at the educational system (UNESCO, IBE 
2011). A school tries to help students gain all learning experiences through 
the curriculum. Experiences are planned for children through their 
educational curriculum (Scottish Government 2009). Learning outcomes 
and some learning experiences are designed in order to teach children at 
school.  
Educational systems are intended to improve children’s knowledge and 
skills. To do so, they need a plan of action and curriculum, and the plan 
consists of teaching methods, learning objectives, assessments, learning 
content and educational materials. The system implements formal and 
non-formal education programs. 
Learning content consists of subject areas. These subject areas have no 
limitation. There might be on any subject. 
Learning objectives are targets for curriculum process. At the end of 
the process, students are supposed to develop attitudes and behaviours and 
to acquire skills and knowledge. Emotional, social, and cognitive 
development is promoted by educational activities. 
Teaching methods are tools to improve knowledge and skills. There 
are various teaching methods and techniques and teachers prefer these 
methods and techniques in terms of their teaching abilities and course 
targets and contents. 
Instructional materials help learners better understand courses. There 
are various teaching and learning materials such as books, maps, teacher’s 
guides, toys and supplementary resources. 
Assessment refers to a measurement tool in order to understand what 
has been learned from the course (knowledge, skills, attitudes…). 
Assessment helps teachers and learners understand how much course goal 
has been reached at the end of educational program (UNESCO 
International Bureau of Education 2016). 

Chapter One 
 
8
A curriculum is a blueprint of learning and teaching and consists of 
many elements such as goals and objectives, content, teaching methods 
and techniques, learning activities and organization of learning 
experiences. The quality of teaching depends to the greatest extent on 
implementing curriculum elements which are strongly connected to each 
other. For instance, if you do not implement the right teaching method or 
technique in the classroom, it is not possible to reach the goals and 
objectives of a course. 
The educational curriculum has various dimensions. There might be 
formal or informal (hidden) structures. Learners should be helped to attain 
knowledge, beliefs, attitudes and some other desirable skills through an 
effective curriculum. The question is what knowledge, what beliefs and 
what attitudes should be taught to learners. Policy makers decide on the 
above questions on systemic scale and subject teachers decide on the 
above questions in terms of course goals.

CHAPTER TWO 
THEORIES IN LANGUAGE LEARNING  
AND TEACHING 
ALINA ANDREEA DRAGOESCU 
 
 
 
This chapter pursues all aspects related to learning and puts forward a 
critical enquiry regarding what confers value upon the educational 
experience. The discussion emphasises language learning, as well as the 
basic factors which affect learning in general – learner motivation, 
language acquisition, and other processes related to cognition – from the 
standpoint of cognitive learning theories. Aspects of cognitive theory 
which will be discussed range from Constructivism, Holistic and Gestalt 
theory to Piaget’s model and other important research conducted in the 
field of learning and teaching. The cognitive approach and its proposed 
methods of language teaching and learning represent the main focus of the 
discussion proposed in this chapter. 
Upon pondering on the real meaning of ‘learning’, two basic trends 
may be noted in the literature on education. The humanistic tradition puts 
forth a discourse inspired by the idea of learning as a goal in itself and 
highlights the self-transformational capability of the learner by means of 
education. On the other hand, the vocational tradition focuses more on 
practical outcomes than on condition validity, on the achievement of very 
specific and measurable competences which are to be acquired. Based on 
these two distinct standpoints, numerous systems of thought have been 
proposed with respect to possible modalities of teaching/learning, among 
which the holistic model is analysed in greater depth. 
What is Learning? 
‘Learning’ may mean different things, depending on whether deep or 
surface connotations are given to the concept. It may be seen as a 
quantitative increase in knowledge as a result of acquiring information, as 

Chapter Two 
12
well as an increased understanding of  reality. Alternatively, it may be 
limited to the meaning of memorising or storing information that can be 
reproduced. It can also be seen as the acquisition of skills and methods that 
can be grasped and then used when necessary in practical contexts. On the 
other hand, learning may also mean simply making sense of abstract 
meaning, relating parts of the subject matter to each other and to the real 
world of experience. 
From an overall educational point of view, what is considered 
‘learning’ is certainly contingent on cultural, social, and various other 
constellations. One may wonder whether learning always serves a good 
purpose, for instance in cases such as learning for learning’s sake or 
learning unlawful skills. However, that domain which is deemed 
‘desirable’ knowledge by society at large generally enjoys an affirmative 
attitude to learning – as the driving force which encourages the evolution 
of human civilisation.  
The philosophy of education further inspires reflection on many critical 
issues – e.g.: Should learning have a teleological or pragmatic end or is it 
desirable and ought to be pursued in and for itself? What may be accepted 
or even cherished as worthwhile knowledge? Which faculties can/should 
be trained and valued? How much and what exactly can one individual set 
forth to learn? Is any type of knowledge accessible to all kinds of learners? 
Thus, as framed by conceptual schools of thought, the subject matter lies 
mainly within the issue of human consciousness and the enduring quest for 
further enhancing the faculties of the human mind.  
However, if the educational system is to be scrutinised under the 
magnifying glass, then one may certainly notice the limits of modern 
learning institutions (Becker in Burgess 1998). Matters of cost-benefit 
pragmatics, the assessment and accreditation procedures of educational 
institutions, overly restrictive curricula, as well as many other limitations 
are often imposed on the content of learning, as much as they are on the 
methods of teaching. It is possible that such factors, and above all the 
teacher in the very classroom, may obstruct or distort, but could also 
inspire quite diverse styles of learning and, hopefully, kindle the will to 
learn. Not least important, the learner comes into play with his/her own 
propensities and predilections, as well as the decisions s/he makes about 
what is worth learning.  
Therefore, teaching must be considered from a larger perspective and 
several points of view, taking into account the interaction between the 
teacher, learner and content that is being taught. The question has been 
asked which of this triad ought to come first, but any one pick and the very 
concept of instating a hierarchy would be arguable and hardly the least 

Theories in Language Learning and Teaching 
13 
unbiased point of view. Regarding the learner, s/he has his/her personal 
values, skills, motivation, and is always different, though also part of a 
larger group of learners. On the other hand, any teacher would certainly 
have his/her level of skill, favoured approach to learning, personal style 
and experience. 
Another important factor in the learning process is the context, 
especially the reasons for learning, whether compulsory education or 
personal choice. The context with all its variables may have considerable 
impact upon the desired outcome of the learning experience. The learner’s 
motivation may also be regarded as part of the context; for instance, if the 
learning is pursued in an instrumental manner because qualifications are 
needed for practical purposes, such aspects may lead to very different 
approaches and outcomes of the educational process. Thus, an alternative 
systemic approach highlights the interconnection between the components 
of the system, pointing out that any change in one component will affect 
the others in their turn. The mental shift underpinning the new systems 
paradigm switches from the fragmentary mechanistic view, from objects, 
to processes and relationships set within the social context (Capra 1997). 
Cognitive Approaches to Learning and Teaching 
Several ways of conceptualising the teaching/learning process have 
been proposed, depending on the influencing factors each model focuses 
on. The most recurrent model generally focuses on the three main 
components of the teaching/learning process: the Learner, the Subject, and 
the Teacher – formally capitalised and impartially presented in alphabetical 
order. The more common Subject-Teacher-Learner (STL) models are 
different from those focusing on the Learner or Subject in that they 
propose different curricula, different procedures, roles and power relations, 
different views on the relevance of the content being taught, which all 
trigger highly different implications which affect the teaching/learning 
process. 
Different approaches to the educational process have favoured one or 
another order of this overall triad, as will be discussed below. One of the 
foremost schools of thought in language acquisition is the cognitive 
approach, which was officially initiated by Ulric Neisser’s Cognitive 
Psychology (1967). Cognitive psychology had already become of great 
importance in the mid 1950’s, when the emphasis shifted away from the 
study of conditioned behaviour and the psychoanalytical study of the 
mind, towards an understanding of human information processing, 
deploying the most rigorous laboratory investigation for this purpose. By 

Chapter Two 
14
the late 1970s, this approach had become the dominant perspective, as the 
work of Piaget (1957) and others drew attention on mental processes and 
internal representation of reality. 
Later, the computer would provide cognitive theorists with the proper 
terminology and with the precise metaphor they needed to investigate the 
human mind. The analogy with the artificial use of computers allowed an 
enhanced understanding of the complexities of human cognition as 
compared with a simulated system like a computer. As it became a tool for 
decoding how the human mind handles information, this representation 
became known as the computer analogy. The paradigm of information 
processing was adopted by cognitive theory to explain the functioning of 
human mind, just as a computer codes, stores, and then processes 
information to produce an output by retrieving stored data. This approach 
was based on a series of assumptions, such as: information from the 
environment is processed by a series of processing systems (e.g. attention, 
perception, short-term memory); the latter transform information in 
systematic ways; information processing in humans resembles computer 
processing. 
As opposed to this approach, behaviourism only studies observable 
external behaviour that can be objectively quantified. From the behaviourists’ 
point of view, internal behaviour cannot be an object of study due to the 
fact that what happens in our minds cannot be seen and objectively 
measured. Behaviourism endorses the physical sciences and it is mainly 
associated with conditioning and stimulus-response processes, which 
entails certain limitations. Regarding the conditions of learning, it is 
largely the teacher that dominates the educational setting from the 
standpoint of behaviourism. The organization of instruction is thus 
essentially profiled according to the guidance of the teacher and the 
learning process is perceived as an imposition upon learners. 
Conversely, the cognitive approach assumes that internal mental 
behaviour can be scientifically studied by means of laboratory or 
classroom experiments. Cognitive psychology also suggests that 
mediational processes occur between stimulus and response or between 
input and output of learning. Such mental events like memory, perception, 
problem solving, etc., are considered meditational processes given that 
they mediate between the stimulus and the response. Although 
behaviourist theory declined during the cognitive revolution of the last 
decades, it remains appreciated as the first psychological account of 
learning. 
Furthermore, Constructivism includes a set of theories closely 
connected to the cognitive approach due to its humanistic perspective on 

Theories in Language Learning and Teaching 
15 
education. This theory looks at the ways learners take in the content to be 
learned and ‘construct’ it inside their mind, but also deals with the output 
learners and teachers construct together through dialogue. However, this 
approach is also limited by the assumption that it is the learner’s role 
mainly to assimilate what the teacher brings forth. From a social point of 
view, Constructivism implies that the learner is more actively involved 
together with the teacher in the cooperative enterprise of constructing 
knowledge. If the learner actively constructs meanings, it falls on the 
teacher to construct a dialogue with the learner, thereby constructing new 
ways of understanding (Vygotsky 1962). 
In the same line of reasoning, George Kelly (1955) is the proponent of 
another related theory, as the very label suggests – Personal Construct 
Psychology (PCP). This theory which offers a far-reaching analysis of 
cognition sees people as products of learning and memory, based on their 
inherent personal construct system. PCP is also a cognitive theory in that it 
envisions learning as the way individuals make sense of the world and 
construct their personal worlds. Kelly’s Personal Construct model aimed at 
replacing previous behaviourist models which limited the learning 
experience to stimulus and response.  
Moreover, behaviourism was also dismissed for its assumption that 
humans are born ‘tabula rasa’ (a blank slate) and lack cognitive functions 
such as schemas, memory or perception. On the contrary, Piaget (1969) 
suggests that children’s minds are not empty, but actively process the 
material with which they are presented by those who help them better 
process meaning. As will be expanded upon later, Piaget proposed the 
accommodation and assimilation processes to account for this insight. 
The most substantial framework of the constructivist theory was put 
forth by Lev Vygotsky (1962) in his elucidation of the ‘Zone of Proximal 
Development’ (ZPD) which he defined as ‘the distance between the actual 
developmental level as determined by independent problem solving and 
the level of potential development as determined through problem solving 
under adult guidance, or in collaboration with more capable peers’ 
(Vygotsky 1978: 86). In empirical research, the author noted that children 
performed tasks better when they engaged in them with an adult rather 
than on their own. It was not necessarily always the case that the adult was 
guiding the children, but that the cooperation with the adult had a refining 
effect upon their thinking. Also, he deemed the development of language 
and articulation of ideas pivotal to learning and development in general.  
Furthermore, Vygotsky also employed the ‘culture’ concept in social 
development theory and pointed out its implications for teaching and 
learning (Daniels 1996). The social dimension of learning is also central to 

Chapter Two 
16
the idea of situated learning and communities of practice. Interaction with 
peers is considered the most highly effective way of developing skills in 
classroom instruction. The author suggests that teachers use cooperative or 
collaborative learning strategies, which would ensure that less competent 
children have a chance to develop with help from more skilful peers 
(Vygotsky 1978). The ZPD has become synonymous in the literature with 
the term ‘scaffolding’, which was introduced by Wood et al. (1976). As 
soon as students in the zone of proximal development, having the benefit 
of scaffolding, have mastered the task, the scaffolding can be removed and 
the students will then be able to complete the task on their own (Wood et 
al. 1976: 90). 
Such theories have had great impact upon the growing current focus on 
collaborative learning, which proposes that group members should have 
different levels of ability so more advanced peers can help less advanced 
members activate within their ‘zone of proximal development’. Moreover, 
‘reciprocal teaching’ is another contemporary application of Vygotsky’s 
ideas, which is used to improve students’ ability to learn from their peers 
with the teacher acting as a mere moderator. This method suggests that 
teachers and students collaborate in learning and enhance skills such as 
questioning and predicting, while the teacher’s role is gradually 
diminished, allowing space for peers to interrelate. 
Another model of teaching in higher education which is also based on 
constructivist theory is David Kolb’s approach, which represents a highly 
expedient model of the learning process and offers a descriptive inventory 
of learning styles. Much of his work is concerned with the learner’s 
internal cognitive processes and involves cognition. The experiential 
learning theory (Kolb 1984) functions on two levels: a four stage cycle of 
learning and four learning styles. The theory of the cycle of adult learning 
includes four stages in learning which follow from each other: Concrete 
Experience is followed by Reflection on that experience, which may then 
be followed by the derivation of general rules describing the previous 
experience, or the application of existing abstract concepts to it (Abstract 
Conceptualisation), hence leading to the construction of ways of adapting 
or altering the following experience (Active Experimentation). Thus, the 
theorist deems learning a coherent ‘process whereby knowledge is created 
through the transformation of experience’ (Kolb 1984: 38). 
Kolb (1984) also proposes a testing instrument (the Learning Style 
Inventory) and an experiential scheme to work with. Concrete Experience 
corresponds to ‘knowledge by acquaintance’, direct practical experience, 
as opposed to ‘knowledge about’ something, which is theoretical and 
represented by the application of Abstract Conceptualisation. The fact that 

Theories in Language Learning and Teaching 
17 
different subject areas call for different learning styles also raises the 
question as to whether a certain discipline requires a particular learning 
style, or whether a preferred learning style leads to choosing an adequate 
subject of study.  
For that reason, there appear to be certain subjects lending themselves 
more easily to Serial learning or to Holistic learning, respectively. For 
example, there are quite different ways of learning foreign languages: 
Structural or Serialist variants on the one hand and Communicative or 
Holistic styles on the other hand. As pertains to learning styles, Holists 
seek an overall framework and then explore areas within it in a less 
organized, organic and spontaneous way, until they have filled in the 
whole. On the contrary, serialists prefer to build up knowledge 
sequentially and favour linear subjects, but they may lose sight of the 
broader picture as they move from one step to the next in line. 
The Piagetian Impact on the Theory of Education 
The cognitive school of thought builds on Gestalt theory regarding the 
holistic approach it takes to learning. Moreover, it has also been 
influenced by Piaget’s study of cognitive development and the perception 
patterns used by learners to decode the perceived world. Of great insight is 
Piaget’s detailed account of the specific stages of development, rather than 
the reduction of learning to a gradual increase in the number and 
complexity of behaviours and acquisition of concepts. The theory elucidates 
the mechanisms by which the child develops into an adult individual who 
can reason based on mental hypotheses and representations. Piaget’s theory 
greatly influenced research in education and has helped enhance the 
functioning of cognitive development. This process is seen as a gradual 
reorganization of cognitive mechanisms occurring in lockstep with 
biological growth and environmental experience.  
Jean Piaget’s cognitive theory includes three main components which 
deserve due analysis: schemas, adaptation processes and the stages of 
development. Schemas are seen by Piaget as the building blocks of 
intelligent behaviour which facilitate the organization of knowledge. In 
other words, they are mental models of the world that are useful in 
employing information from past experience or planning future action on 
the basis of such cognitive patterns. They each relate to aspects such as 
objects, actions and abstract concepts, and allow the formation of mental 
representations of the world (Piaget 1957). Adaptation processes (equilibrium, 
assimilation and accommodation) enable the transition from one stage to 
another in the course of learning. As to the stages of development 

Chapter Two 
18
(sensorimotor, 
preoperational, 
concrete 
operational, 
and 
formal 
operational), these bring forth the gradual development of cognitive 
processes.  
Schemata can also be seen as ‘index cards’ (Wadsworth 2004) filed in 
the brain which an individual uses in order to understand and to respond to 
incoming stimuli according to a mental script. Piaget (1957) illustrated the 
relevance of schemas in cognitive development and how their complexity 
developed gradually along the stages. Intellectual growth is seen as a 
process of adaptation to the world by means of two mechanisms: 
Assimilation and Accommodation (Piaget and Cook 1952). The former 
occurs when an existing schema is used to deal with a new situation, 
whereas the latter is involved when the existing schemata fail and must be 
replaced in order to understand a new situation (Wadsworth 2004).  
As an adaptation process, equilibration is the force which triggers 
development and disequilibrium takes place when new information cannot 
be decoded through existing schemas by means of assimilation. 
Equilibration is also the basis of the learning process, as an individual in 
disequilibrium will seek to restore equilibrium and avoid frustration by 
means of accommodation. Thus, the process of assimilating new schemata 
will be pursued until the following necessity to make an adjustment 
presents itself.  
As regards the theory of stages, Piaget described the four universal 
stages of cognitive development a child undergoes in order to build a 
mental representation of the world (Piaget and Inhelder 1969). This 
biological progression enfolds as the child matures, and the approximate 
ages that correspond on average to each stage are based on empirical 
observation. In the Sensorimotor Stage (until 2 years of age), children 
have already gained the ability to form a mental representation of an 
object, for instance they can recognize the fact that an object still exists, 
even if it is hidden. Further on, in the Preoperational Stage (2-7 years old), 
the ability to think symbolically is developed and children can now make a 
word stand for something else, but they still have difficulty assuming the 
viewpoint of others. The next step, the Concrete Operational Stage (7-11 
years) is considered a major turning point in the child’s cognitive 
development because it marks the beginning of logical or operational 
thought. At this stage, children start working things out mentally rather 
than physically trying them out. Finally, during the Formal Operational 
Stage (from approximately age eleven into adulthood), the abilities to use 
abstract concepts and logically relate ideas start developing (Piaget and 
Inhelder 1969). 

Theories in Language Learning and Teaching

While Piaget proposes a systematic theory based on stages and a step-
by-step progression along ages of the child or learner, Vygotsky deems 
cognitive development a continuous process. In contrast to the Piagetian 
view, the Russian author believes ‘instruction cannot be identified as 
development, but properly organized instruction will result in the child’s 
intellectual development, will bring into being an entire series of such 
developmental processes, which were not at all possible without 
instruction’ (Vygotsky, 1962: 121). Also, in contrast to Piaget’s view of 
the universality of stages in learning, Vygotsky focuses more on effects of 
culture in shaping cognitive development. Moreover, cognitive development 
is purportedly variable across cultures, whereas Piaget views cognitive 
development as being largely universal across cultures (Dasen 1994).  
Neither does Bruner include a theory of the stages in his theory of 
learning, which places more emphasis on the child’s capacity to 
understand any meaning and acquire complex information irrespective of 
the age. ‘We begin with the hypothesis that any subject can be taught 
effectively in some intellectually honest form to any child at any stage of 
development’ (Bruner 1960: 33). Bruner (1960) also explained how this 
was possible through the concept of the spiral curriculum, which implies 
that information be structured so that complex ideas can be first taught at a 
simplified level and later engaged again at more complex levels. The spiral 
analogy refers to the fact that subjects are to be taught at levels of 
gradually increasing difficultly. This method of teaching would ideally 
equip children with the ability to complete tasks and eventually solve 
problems by themselves.  
Furthermore, the purpose of education is to develop symbolic thinking, 
to facilitate reasoning and problem solving skills which learners can 
transfer to real-life situations (Bruner 1960). Bruner (1961) regards 
students as active learners who construct their own knowledge by 
employing a coding system which sorts out information. The broadening 
of this coding system is best achieved through discovery rather than by 
receiving instructions from the teacher. The philosophy of discovery 
learning, also acknowledged as a Constructivist approach, relies on the 
fact that students construct their own knowledge for themselves. The role 
of the teacher is reduced to facilitating the learning process by the students 
and not to teaching information by routine memorisation in the traditional 
manner. Thus, a good teacher provides learners with the information they 
need without organizing it for them, but encouraging them to discover 
meanings by themselves. 
Both Bruner and Vygotsky place emphasis upon the learner’s environment 
and particularly on social factors which contribute to cognitive development. 

Chapter Two 
20
They both agree on the social nature of learning and contend that others 
should assist the child in developing skills through the process of 
scaffolding (Wood et al. 1976). As reviewed by Bruner, scaffolding refers 
to ‘the steps taken to reduce the degrees of freedom in carrying out some 
task so that the child can concentrate on the difficult skill she is in the 
process of acquiring’ (Bruner 1978: 19). This idea parallels Vygotsky’s 
‘zone of proximal development’, as both require collaboration between an 
adult and a child in order to support the child achieve a learning task. 
Given that language is seen as the foundation of cognitive processes, 
considerable emphasis is also placed on the role of language. Vygotsky 
adds that learning occurs in social contexts in cooperation with more 
skilful people, which essentially affords language opportunities. Thus, the 
internalization of language is seen as the root of cognitive development 
(Daniels 1996). By the same token, Bruner (1961) deems symbolic 
representation and language as being fundamental in determining cognitive 
development. On the other hand, according to Piaget, language depends on 
thought for its development and it is seen as subordinate to action. The 
Russian psychologist argues that the development of language and thought 
cannot be separated and that cognition is rooted in our interactions with 
others rather than in the contact with the material world (Vygotsky 1978).  
Although the writings of Vygotsky have yet to be explored, researchers 
have expounded the manifold educational implications of Piaget’s theory, 
showing how it can be applied to teaching and learning. His work (1952, 
etc.) has been extremely influential in developing teaching practice and 
policy across the world, having massive educational implications. Some of 
his most influential concepts are the relevance of play in learning, the 
applicability of the environment, learning by discovery and the importance 
of individual learning according to the corresponding stages of cognitive 
growth. 
In conclusion, the following approach should be encouraged in the 
classroom: focusing on the process of learning rather than its end product; 
using individual activities as much as collaborative ones so children may 
learn from peers; prompting conditions that present valuable problem-
solving situations; and using active methods that require discovering and 
reconstructing meanings. Since problem-solving skills cannot be taught 
but must be discovered, cognitive growth requires that learners be active, 
not passive. In general, teaching should be student-centred and encourage 
active discovery learning within the classroom. The role of the teacher is 
essentially that of a facilitator of learning.

Summary 
The main emphasis in the present chapter is put on language learning – 
from the standpoint of cognitive learning theories, as well as the basic 
factors which affect learning. The methods of teaching, the diverse 
learning styles of the learners, the content as well as the context of 
learning, and other such factors are contemplated in detail, as they may 
hinder or enforce the educational process. The learner comes into play 
with their own skills, motivation, and predilections, and makes his/her 
own decisions about what it is worth learning. On the other hand, the 
teacher also has his/her personal values and experience, different level of 
skill, and prefers a certain approach to learning. 
The models of teaching in higher education which have been discussed 
are meant to provide readers with the most significant forms of the 
learning processes and methods. The chapter also furnishes a descriptive 
inventory of learning styles and discusses an extensive array of language 
teaching approaches and methods, while surveying research on language 
acquisition and its theoretical foundations. Among favoured learning 
styles, the experiential scheme highlights direct practical experience which 
corresponds to ‘knowledge by acquaintance’. Also, if different subject 
areas call for different learning styles, languages present themselves as 
subjects which are well suited to a holistic approach as a preferred learning 
style. Among the favoured ways of learning foreign languages, for 
instance, the communicative (holistic) style is promoted as a variant which 
seeks an overall framework and explores it in a less organized but more 
natural manner. 
As proposed by this chapter, an alternative systemic approach highlights 
the relatedness of all system components, pointing out that any change in 
one of these will certainly affect the others in their turn. Thus, the 
educational process is considered from a larger systemic perspective, 
taking into account the interaction between the teacher, the learner and the 
context of learning. Such aspects may lead to largely different outcomes of 
the learning process, taking into consideration processes and interrelatedness 
rather than objects and separate aspects of the educational experience.
