Kind: captions Language: en Dr. Aloc, welcome back to the Ravi show. Pleasure to be here. You said that sometimes when you're doing your brain surgery, some memories may be missing. They are missing and they don't know it's missing. Computer brain interfaces here. Does that mean that your biology can also get hacked? Now there is a danger. You'll be able to completely influence the brain in many many ways. How do you explain the subconscious mind to a 5-year-old? Everything that has happened in the past, all the events, the hurts, the pains, the traumas, the joys and the sorrows, they are all in the subconscious mind. One of the problems of humankind is that our brain is always living in the past and the future because of the subconscious. I may know that alcohol is not good for me, but the craving for it is so much those chemicals and agents go and stick to those areas of the brain. Now the brain cannot get stimulated by anything else. Reality is created by the logical mind. But expectations are created by the emotional. Absolutely. The suffering of all of mankind is purely because of the imbalance between the two. Now I am hoping that the digital technology things like neural link brings about harmony between the lower and the higher brain. What's the first superpower that computer brain interfaces will give us? The most important thing that we see right now is Dr. Alo Sharma is a neurosurgeon who we've featured on TRS in the past. He's got his own cult audience because his subject matter is always practically important for all of us. Neuroscience is one of those domains of biology that is being researched upon heavily and neuroscientists all over the world are constantly finding newer secrets of the brain. We're discovering deeper layers of our own mind. Today's episode is about these slightly deeper layers. Of course, we've spoken about meditation. sleep, neuroplasticity, but this is an attempt to help you understand about the higher states of the brain. What is the human body evolving into next? We came from monkeys, but where are we going? These are the kind of questions that'll be answered in this neuroscience special of TRS. It's for anyone who enjoys psychology and brain biology. Features Dr. Aluk Sharma on TRS. Once again, [Music] Dr. Aloc, welcome back to the Renvi show. Pleasure to be here. Uh let's dive straight in. Yeah. Oh, wait. Before we dive straight in, there's something I I want to talk about. I want to share. Uh and it's in context with what happened recently. Your response to everything that happened in life. We all make mistakes. We make errors. You know, things happen to all of us. That those are things we can't control. However, our response to that is in our hands. And what I want you to know is the way you responded was in my views in in my opinion the classic definition of the word equity. There is a word in English called equanity. Equity is about being balanced about being calm and about being serene in the middle of whatever happens. And I believe that your responses were u you know a definition of equimity. They were mature. Uh we never saw you go off the handle. We never saw you criticize anybody. Uh you were apologetic where it had to be. You were, you know, uh firm where you had to be. So not just as somebody who has been on your podcast, but as somebody who is your parents age. I mean I'm I'm the same age as your parents. Uh as a medical doctor, as a neurosurgeon, as a neuroscientist, as a medical teacher, you know, I've been a medical teacher for 30 years, about a 100 students going through us every year. I want you to know that my respect for you uh is actually enhanced. Thank you. You know, and you know, when I did my podcast with you earlier, because of your age, you were always I always saw you as a kid. Okay. You're well known and well known in the field but you're still a kid today. I see you with different eyes. You know I I see that you have grown and matured. Uh so as in that capacity that my respect, my closeness, my affection for you has not changed a little bit. In fact, it's just got enhanced. Thank you. Even from that generation, all right, uh at no point did anybody uh think of anything that happened and anything that is negative. There was all they were always supportive, caring of everything that you've done and everything that you did. So I just wanted you to know that. Thank you. So thank you. Means a lot. All I'll say is I really enjoy my job. I really enjoy dissecting knowledge and I really enjoy meeting people like yourself where I can extract that knowledge for the sake of the world but also obviously for the sake of my own curiosity. So I don't know if you're familiar with this show called Black Mirror but uh it's basically it's a horror show without ghosts. The villain or the ghost is the dark aspect of technology. So they try highlighting technologies that already exist around us or are currently being developed in the present and how those technologies will affect human life. And one of the hot topics within Black Mirror uh as well as the show called Severance is what we call the computer brain interface. Now sir, you're a brain surgeon but I have hung out with you as well. So I know that you're a student when it comes to the subject of neuroscience. um you're already working with stem cell therapies. Uh I think that you're one of those doctors who's on the cutting edge of medical tech. My first question to you is related to this computer brain interface angle. Uh I think it's going to be made completely public within 5 years time. How long have you been a brain surgeon for? Since 1992. Okay. So 30 years. 30 years. Yeah. Um, did you ever think of this reality where technology will make its way into the biology of the brain? Well, actually that's a very interesting question because they have already done this. So um uh you know in the late 1990s I was the first to do something called motor cortex stimulation for intractable pain where we took electrodes and implanted the electrodes onto the motor cortex and then uh connected it to a pacemaker which was below and that stimulated uh the you know the motor cortex and removed the most difficult and intractable pain that there was. What is the motor cortex? Uh the motor cortex is a part of the brain that actually controls our movements. But uh when the motor cortex gets stimulated, it suppresses the pain you know and uh so there was uh you know pain which would not respond to anything we were able to do that. So my first experience was in implanting electrodes on the brain. Subsequently I implanted a lot of electrodes for patients in coma. So we have patients in intractable coma uh who are just unconscious in a vegetative state and what we would do is we would take electrodes and and put it implanted in the cervical spine and again stimulate the brain uh so that if there was any possibility of recovery they would recover. So I've already worked with this. Uh and did it work with them? Yeah. So it did work. The the pain uh it helped significantly. Then in the coma we had some patients who did improve and um uh you know uh one of them was actually Ramnad Parker. He was a well-known cricket. I used to open with Gawaskar. He had a a very uh severe accident and injury and I I did his uh stimulation operation. In fact the whole Indian cricket team had a benefit match just to be able to support him for that. Okay. So, I've already done this, but when I was doing this, the technology was not as refined, you know, the electrodes were larger, uh the the equipment was a little, you know, what it was 15, 20 years ago. But now with everything getting, you know, microized, smaller, more easy to control, earlier we had to, you know, have wires coming out and stimulators. Now, you can do a whole lot of this wirelessly. uh I believe the future will be an interface of technology with the brain because at the end the human brain is also you know one of the most fascinating brilliant uh computer-like creations that nature has ever evolved. Yeah. Uh I'm an engineer, you're a doctor. I see the world in terms of systems, flowcharts and perhaps the flow of electricity and power within those systems. That's what a computer is. It's a flow of electricity. Uh that's not exactly how the human body and brain operate. Even though it's a very complex system, even though it has its own form of electricity, do you visualize a future where all of us in this room will actually have chips implanted in our brains? All right. So the brain also functions through transmission of electricity. Is this the basis of computer brain interfaces? Partly partly. So what you have to understand is that in the brain everything is a equilibrium. Okay. Everything is balanced. For every one action there is a counter action. So the brain is in a constant state of awareness and then when you decide I have to do this now to do this the other things have to be suppressed right and then you focus on this one thing. Now using electrical interface it's possible to enhance or suppress and sometimes it's not just stimulation. Sometimes you want to inhibit something and sometimes you want to stimulate something. So one of so there are three ways to do it. You can do it chemically through drugs. Okay. You can do it biologically for from the work I do that is using stem cells. You give stem cells and then you stimulate parts of the brain or you could do it electrically. And I think the future with chips getting smaller, we'll be able to enhance our ability to do things. We'll become more efficient. I believe it is the future. Okay. Uh what's the first practical superpower that these computer brain interfaces will give us? because I know that Neuralink which is Elon Musk's organization uh their first game is to help people who are dealing with any kind of neurological issue. Once they get past chapter one of their journey, I'm pretty sure they're going to go into some kind of brain enhancement or ability enhancement uh product when it comes to those computer brain interfaces. So because you're a brain surgeon, my question to you is what's the first likely superpower that we will gain as human beings. So like you said, first is about disease and disorders. Yes. The most important thing that we see right now is paralysis or stroke. You know, so when somebody is paralyzed, half the body is not moving and by using this we are likely to be able to able to give movement back. That's one hope. Also there are several other diseases you know uh in in adults for example in dementia or Alzheimer's there's a likelihood that by stimulating various parts of the brain we'll be able to enhance the memory and we may not be able to improve their condition but we may be able to slow down the deterioration. Now when it comes to uh regular people who don't have a medical problem, what is the the future for us? So the future for us is going to be uh in the ability. So each one of us first have you know each one of us is different. Each one of us has different skills like you were in a class. Maybe somebody stood first. Okay. But that person may not have been good in sports or somebody stood 10. Maybe he was a good cricketer but he couldn't paint and somebody stood maybe 20th who was a great painter or a musician but could not be could not play games or study. So different. So today the the concept of what is normal is being removed and people are being looked at either as neurotypical or neurodeiverse. This especially with relation to conditions like autism and intellectual disability. We are saying don't look at anybody as being less than. Somebody is typical like us and somebody is different or exceptional like the others. So uh the enhancement you know one of the things that we may work on is memory. All right. Uh we might be able to uh I'm not saying I'm for it. Okay. But it may be likely that we may be implanting chips that may enhance our attention, focus and our ability to memorize. Now, uh that may not be needed today. See, times have changed. When we were students, we didn't have the internet, we didn't have computers, we had nothing. So, we had to memorize. Today, the need for me for memory is not there as much. All right? However, it is likely that by doing this, you know, the the ability to be able to take on and handle large volumes of data uh may be improved. Okay, that's that's one of the first things that that people may be interested in. And I believe that what is needed is a combination of all of this and that the traditional systems of education now, the traditional systems of evaluating are all going to go in the dust bin soon. Okay? because you don't need the many things that you were taught earlier you may not need now. However, there is a there's a lot of information that needs to be processed to you know for future disruptive technologies you know for for being able to uh be able to see the world differently and both will need it. Those who are apparently doing well in school okay and those who are apparently not doing well because those who are not doing well actually have a different level of brilliance. Okay. And that is a brilliance that changes the world. The people who've changed the world are not the people who stood first in class. They were the people who didn't do so well in class, but they brought about technology that changed the world. And so suddenly you're going to find that uh this digital interface is going to bridge the gap between the two between seeing the world in its wider larger context and you know seeing the world in a focused context. That is where the bridging will happen. backbenches are more likely to do well. They actually changed the world. You know, I can give you a whole list of some of the greatest inventions and none of those people were people who were No. Yeah. All of Yeah. I think I think you know as much as I respect someone who does well in school I think that for many of them not all of them but for many of them it's almost like it's a lifelong uh weight that they have to carry on their shoulders because they're so used to doing everything perfectly that it kind of at least in my experience I've noticed it takes away from their risk appetite later on in life and eventually if you really want to break out from the pack it's about taking risks it's about gambling just a little bit calculated gambles abs and and there's a neuroscience to it and again you know from uh so we you know we like I said I treat a lot of kids with autism and we do their brain scans so we finding the medial temporal area these are the areas responsible for memory okay uh for emotions and stuff like that so when we do the scans we find that in kids with autism their cerebellum their small brain and the medial temporal areas are hyper metabolic are not working as well you can see it it's a color scan so you can see that it's not working however what we have found is that other parts of the brain are working more than normal. Okay, they you know they they have an ability to see things that we cannot see. Okay, so there are two parts. There is the what is called the parietal occipital area. The oxipital is the visual area and there is the frontal area the area that does the executive thinking. So these people can see things you know like Einstein Einstein you know is known it is known that he had autism okay but he he saw the way he saw light the way he you know created E is equal to MC square he saw things that no scientist had seen before so that's what I'm saying we need both and I believe that you know the technology like Neuralink is going to bridge that gap what if we had both I mean that's my Gotcha. Wow. Okay. Uh so on the other end of the spectrum is the strength of the backbenchos who can see society for what it is not or for what it truly is. That's why they're the ones who become who more likely to become entrepreneurs. Absolutely. Because what is entrepreneurship? It's 0ero to one. It's creating something that doesn't exist. Yes. Got it. So this is the neuroscience of why backbentures are more suited to entrepreneurship. Absolutely. versus benches who are suited for a flourishing corporate career. Something like that. One set follows the rules well, one set breaks the rules. Well, the world needs both. All of us lie somewhere on the spectrum. Yes. Neural link is likely to give everyone the strengths of both sides. That's perfectly said. You put it in a nutshell beautifully. Yeah. So, every rich person in the 2030s is going to be a superhum. Yes. Maybe that's the practical truth. Whoever can afford early neural link will very interesting the person who created Neurolink Elon Musk himself had autism he had something called asperes that's a high functioning autism and you see what this man has created you know when in my in the 80s when I learned driving if somebody told me one day cars would drive without petrol it was like science fiction one man did it one man did it okay he's talking of sending missions to Mars he created neural link so he himself is a classic example of somebody who may not have been a, you know, topper in his class, but see what he's accomplished. He's a living example. Okay, there's an obvious kind of scary question which is also related to cyber security because we've had some cyber security experts on the show and because we're talking about computer brain interfaces here, effectively your biology will be linked to a computer system. So if that computer system gets hacked, does that mean that your biology can also get hacked? What's your opinion as a brain surgeon? All right. So, the way I see uh you know neurolink and this interface between the brain and the computer, it's going to be more things that will be done to our brain rather than things being taken out from our brain. So things like our memory okay our emotions at this point it is very difficult for any form of technology to extract it for the simple reason that it's not located in one region okay although they are areas focused on memory but our things are spread out over a a rather you know wide area and a lot of these things are in the subconscious a lot of the these things are are abstract they are divided Because the brain functions to different layers. There are layers and layers of functioning to be able to extract this information. I can't see science doing it right now. So right now the interface is what the technology will give to the brain rather than what it'll take out from the brain right now. The logic of this based on what you're saying is that memories and personality are stored all over the physical structure of the brain. So first we're going to have to find a technology that's able to scan the entire brain which is a very complex structure. We've not actually been able to map out the whole neurological pattern of any human being I believe until like individual you can make out so you can do scans you know you can do there's something called functional MRI scans there are something called PET CD scans where you can make out which parts of the brain are working when and how. All right. But to be able to extract what information is there, you know, I can't see and I'm not saying it won't happen. I mean, anything is possible where that information will be extractable. Gotcha. But you're saying that from the computer you will be able to influence the brain. Lots of things. You'll be able to completely you know influence the brain in many many ways. Now there is a danger because then you can have you don't know how you know depending on who does it where it is done you know how you're going to influence at what age are you going to influence you know doing it to adults is one thing doing it to children is another you know and then you you might want to influence a entire group or class of people for a particular point of view. So there are potential dangers in all kinds of technology. For example, uh a brain okay has got a covering brain that's called the cerebral cortex which we call the cold or the human brain and there is a deeper brain which we call the hot brain which is a more reptilian and what is called a paleomian brain you know so there is a hot brain inside and there is a cold brain on top. So the way the nervous system has evolved. So you know life started on earth with as single cells you know like amoeba single cells and then those cells multiplied and then you had organism in the earlier stage. Then when it became multiple cells now these cells had to be controlled. So the nervous system was created. Initially it was a net a neural net and it was on the outside. And then as animals evolved when you know when you come to the earthworm you'll see that the ner I don't know whether in school you dissected the earthworm in our time we had to dissect there's a spinal cord in the center okay so the earthworm has just one spinal cord and there's a ring on top all right and now this whole nervous system gradually kept on evolving to become the brain now in all of us all of us the lowest part of our brain is a reptilian brain is exactly like that of a lizard Exactly. All right. Above that is something called a paleomian brain which a dog or a horse or a lion and above that is a human brain. So we we have three layers of brains. All right. when anybody whether whether it's in politics or whether it's in religion or whether it's nationality okay in any way what Hitler did or what you know any leaders of the past have done is you can actually directly reach out to the lower brains in people okay because the lower brain the so the reptilian brain is about the moment you know it does whatever it's it's only about food, you know, hunger, taste, living, you know, stuff like that. The higher brain, the paleo has some degree of awareness, some degree of emotion, like a dog, you know, has some degree of emotions and stuff. Now, that has not changed in us. So, deep inside us, we still have animal brains. Okay? The higher brain controls this. Now it is possible by the way you communicate for people to reach out to others animal brains and that is what leads to what is called a herd mentality. That is what leads to people getting together and creating problems or situations or fighting amongst each other on different grounds. Mob mentality. The mob mentality. The mob mentality is all about the reptilian the mamalian brain getting hacked and that cuts off the the higher brain right so it's happening by words already okay it's happening by language already in fact they say language is human our greatest asset it's also actually the biggest villain because people use words and language to sway entire mobs you know so it's already happening okay now imagine if you could do it with a digital interface is how powerful that would be. Okay. So, effectively the reptilian brain is still a part of your own human brain today. Yeah. Absolutely. And through psychological conditioning of different kinds that society can inflict on your own human existence, you can influence a human beings is reptilian brain. Absolutely. And I think a very practical place that we see this happening is in the world of politics. Yes. which is why political speeches have to be extremely simple and direct. Yes. Uh you when Trump got elected for the first time, uh communication skill coaches attributed the words he chose to use in his rallies as a key factor in him winning votes because he said some deeply offensive things and he used extremely simple words. Effectively, Donald Trump has hacked the reptilian brains. Absolutely. Um, I'm going to twist this whole conversation now. Yeah. How many brain surgeries have you performed? Thousands. Okay. I've lost track. I remember when we spoke on our first ever podcast, you said that sometimes when you're doing a brain surgery, you almost feel like you're cutting through someone's life's memories. Mhm. Because sometimes when they come out of the brain surgery, some memories may be missing. No, they are missing. They are missing and they don't know. They don't know that it's missing. which testifies to the fact that memories are stored all over your brain. Right? Um my question to you sir is physically speaking where is the subconscious mind and the second adjacent question is is the subconscious mind even a physical entity or is it a theme from the world of spiritualism and psychology? Okay, that that's a brilliant question. So what you have to understand is the brain like every other part of a body or like every part of nature has a dual face. There's there's a god called Janus who's got two heads. One head looks forward, one head looks backwards. That's why the month January is named after Janus because in January you look back at the year that went and you look ahead at the year that happened. Now the human brain does exactly that. There are two parts of the human brain. One part where it looks after itself. It is self focus, introspective. It is about self-s survival. And there's another part that integrates this with the environment, with society, with family and friends. So there is a part that looks in and there's a part that looks out. Okay. Now this happens everywhere. Each cell of our body, each cell is actually looking to survive in its own self. But it's also looking how it will interface with other cells and so every part of the our body is like that but the brain in particular. Now uh how how is this in terms of the hardware and the software. All right. So u humans have a brain that is able to look at the consequences of its action. So when like you do something you know what will be the outcome there is what is good bad right wrong choices consequences this is all what the cerebral cortex or the higher brain does and then like we discussed there is a lower brain that deals only with food hunger thirst anger emotion right so there are two parts the lower brain is inwardlooking it is about selfpreservation It's about it's it's ego and more. It's pure. If you're hungry, it wants food. It doesn't care where you get the food from. If you're thirsty, it wants water. So, whatever it wants, it wants it and it wants it now. All right? So, this is the inwardlooking brain and there's the outward-looking brain. Now if you see evolution and there's a lot that have been uh written on this what has happened is normally when things evolve whatever is lower you know is controlled by whatever is higher normally there's a control you know for example the spinal cord is under control of the lower brain if the if there's an instruction given the spinal cord doesn't have a choice whether to trans you know if you say I have to walk the spine spinal cord can't say no I will not let you it'll pass that signal it doesn't have a control whereas in the brain the midbrain I'm talking about the mamlian or reptilian brain this actually you know it may not block but it there's a conflict between the two all right between what between logic reason and emotion you know there's a constant conflict I mean uh the suffering of all of mankind is purely because of this the imbalance between the M right suffering happens when reality doesn't meet expectations. Yeah, that's philosophy. So basically uh reality is created by the logical mind but expectations are created by the emotional. Absolutely. Perfect. Okay. Perfectly said. Your own reptilian brain wants the world to be ideal, wants everything that you wish to happen. Then your higher brain processes the reality of the world around you. And when those two outcomes don't match, that's what creates frustration for you. Yeah. Okay. So that creates anger and that that very often leads to almost everything including you know whether it's addictions or whether it is you know uh behavior that is not completely correct as far as society's norms go. So all of this is a conflict between two brains. Both of them are our brains. Okay. Uh but there's a conflict between these two brains. And of course the best way out is something that you practice yourself and that is meditation okay because meditation is the only tool okay that brings about harmony between the lower and the higher brain it's the only tool available now I am hoping that the digital technology you know things like neural link may may be able to do what meditation does so this harmony between those two brains means What biologically speak let's take an addiction all right I may know that alcohol is not good for me or I may know that you know some other you know taking other drugs but the craving for it is so much your higher brain is telling you it's not good okay it completely overrules that right so this is all basically electrical transmission and neurochemicals you know that that that are playing with each other right so what does meditation do when you're meditating what are you doing all right when you're medit meditating uh there is a silencing of the mind all right and the brain waves so just to let you know we have brain waves in us all right so there are different levels of brain brain waves so when you're concentrating on something there's actually something called gamma waves okay that is when say you're reading a book or you're trying to study something so your gamma waves are are there like even right now no this this is different so right now we are in the beta wave fame. So when you're talking to somebody, see when you're concentrating, when you're reading a book, let's say you're doing research on a topic, right? That time it is gamma waves. When you're talking to somebody, it is beta waves. When you're giving a speech or a lecture, right? Now our beta waves are completely active. Okay? You understand the difference between concentration and and uh interaction. Now let us say we took a break after this and you know we just sat went out for coffee. Now our alpha waves will go into rhythm. So alpha waves is the little more more you know little more relaxed where you aren't uh you're not sleeping but it is you're relaxed alpha. Let's say after this you want to take a nap then then you go into what is called the theta wave. You know when you theta wave is a wave which is you know the the way you're feeling just before you sleep. Okay, that's theta which by the way is also the wave when you're driving long distances on a highway you know actually your theta waves get activated that is why they're accidents because you're sort of pre-sleep you know if you're driving on the atal setu you know after for some time you start feeling actually because your theta waves are activated and the last when you go into sleep it is delta waves deep sleep deep sleep it's delta waves deep sleep now when you're meditating it's your alpha and theta waves that are active any form of meditation and there's lot of there hundreds of papers to show that so your alpha wave is the wave when you are relaxing but alert see the beauty of meditation it doesn't put you to sleep it calms you but your mind is still alert that is alpha okay and the theta waves is the calming it's silencing out you know the distractions so the beauty of meditation is is these waves okay Now again I believe that you know interfacing the brain with computers might be able to bring us into a state. you know I I know how many hours you spend meditating you know I mean um uh you you have a a phenomenal spiritual side to you but that's not humanly possible I mean for everybody to do I mean you know in today's world with with this you know how many people can spend an hour meditating in the morning right so sometimes we have to use technology so this is you know I'll give you another example all our diseases and our problem whether it's cardiac neuro everything else is primarily because of lack of oxygen Okay. In our body hypoxia eskemia ideally when you do pranayam when you do yoga in what are you doing in yoga you're deep breathing oxygen. Okay. And if you do it long enough the oxygen is going under pressure. Now that is helping you heal and prevent disease. But can everybody do pranayam for half an hour 1 hour? No. So what do we do? We take medical technology. We have in a hospital hyperbaric oxygen chambers. You must have you must be aware of hyperbaric oxygen. A lot of people are using it for anti-aging. What does hyperbaric oxygen do? It pushes oxygen under pressure. So in 1 hour, you know, so it's easier for people to go into a chamber and breathe oxygen than to do 1 hour of pranayam. One hour of pranayam is difficult. Okay. I've tried I can't do more than 15 minutes. Okay. What if you do the pranayam inside the oxygen chamber? I think that would be like some a different level only. So have you understood? Yeah. What are natural systems? What our ancient traditions are saying? What that pranayam is good for health? People can't do it. So now we using technology to do exactly what pranayam is doing. Ideally meditation is a tool everybody should be doing. But if you can't do it, what if technology did that for you? What if you could create alpha and theta waves in the brain? Got can you speak a little bit more about these waves? Yeah. Yeah. uh when you say that the brain is vibrating in alpha or gamma I am assuming that there have been scientific studies where they measured the outputs of the brain lots lots of them hundreds of papers then categorize those outputs into alpha beta gamma theta and delta right uh now for the end user who's listening to this podcast from a practical perspective uh what's your advice as a doctor alpha and theta is is a relax is when you when want to relax, wind down, you know, but you can't go through life living in alpha and theta, if you have to study, okay, if you have to do a job, if you have to work on a project, if somebody has to do coding, when somebody's doing coding, an IT professional, he has to be in a total gamma, you know, he has to be focusing on what he's doing. If he's if he's trying to do a programming or if let's say as a surgeon, okay, if I'm operating on the brain, I can't be in alpha and theta. I have to be in gamma. That is concentrated. when I'm talking let's say I'm taking a lecture for students and theta beta beta okay because have you understood so we need all of these what happens is today's today's life everybody is either concentrating on doing something or in this mode and so we don't we don't take the breaks for alpha we don't take the the so you need to have a balance of both okay that's okay so gamma okay so your brain concentration so your brain is vibrating in the gamma state when you're focused constant focused focused on job. I would also assume highly productive individuals are able to stay in that gamma state much longer. Yes. Correct. Yeah. So, so that is attention. So, your front benches, okay, your front benches, they are the more gamma gamma because they concentrate, you know. Gotcha. Is there any way to improve your brain's ability to stay in the gamma state for long? Um, starting first uh sleep. Okay. because they found that unless you have had 8 hours of full sleep, you know, your uh attention concentration areas are lesser. Second, uh exercise again they found that if you exercise regularly um when you're giving attention to things, you can do it better. Then diet of course makes a big difference for your ability for your brain to stay in its gamma state. gamma also although it's not good but things like u caffeine coffee and tea will help you you know focus longer alcohol will will put you in a in your alpha and theta state so so these things help you know um caffeine actually focus helps you to uh focus more on on the things that you have to do so then um again meditation is something that's again very useful you know I'm going keep coming to meditation because there is nothing better than meditation for actually all of these things you know and um like they say that when you are completely focused on a job when you're completely into it you sort of get into that uh you can it can become for you a meditative state as well you know when you're when you're you're not doing it as en when it's it's just a part of you when you and your work become one you know it's not something you are doing I I like to put it like that. Your head, your heart, and your hands are all in sync. The three H's. Wow. Okay. What a fascinating conversation. Okay. I have to go back to the subconscious mind. How do you explain the subconscious mind to a 5-year-old? What is it in the first place? Because I've actually had 10 different people give me 10 different explanations on the show, but I would like to hear the brain surgeon talking about the subconscious mind. All right. So again there are layers in the brain. What is the conscious mind? Okay the conscious mind does the following activities. The first the conscious mind has memory. Second the conscious mind has intelligence the ability to you know do things. Third the conscious mind controls body movements. All right. Okay. If I had to give a simple example, if the conscious mind is a is a is on the stage, a play that is happening or a music concert, whatever is happening at the back of the stage is the subconscious mind. So there is a lot happening in the background that is letting you do all these things which that your conscious mind is doing. All right? Now in the subconscious mind, what all is there? So there is a huge lot of data. Okay. Now this data is of everything that has happened in the past. Okay. So whatever has happened in childhood you know particular relationship with the parents they found that you know our relationship with our parents is one of the fundamental programming of our subconscious brain. Okay. And uh then all the events, the hurts, the pains, the traumas, the joys and the sorrows, they are all in the subconscious mind. They at the back. You don't see them every day, but they are there. And they are influencing what is happening to your to your conscious mind. So your conscious mind right now whatever you're thinking you know our conscious mind is active but at the back end there is a huge lot of data which is which is now controlling what is happening in the front end. All right. Now, this is the psychology based explanation, right? This is the psychology. Now, there's the neuros the neuroscience-based explanation. So, now when do you see when do you get to see your subconscious? Uh it's like it's difficult to see your subconscious. But the time when you really get a sense of it is in dreams. Okay? Because in your dreams a lot of your subconscious starts playing up. Now, with regard to dreams, there are two views. There was the old Freuden view which actually looks at it as just repressed emotions and you know it's a more psychological view but today there is a more neuroscience view a neuroscience perspective to what is happening in our dreams. So basically in in our daytime I mean in our awake time sorry not daytime you know the brain is working there's so much happening there is there is emotions there is interaction there is changes there is there is a lot of stuff happening now uh in the night when you sleep housekeeping needs to be done because you know whatever's happened in the day uh the subconscious mind actually takes all that and stacks it stores it there are different parts of the brain And you know there is there's something called the hippocampus which uh you know it's like a seahorse shape which stacks memory you know literally shells the memory. There's the amydala that's concerned with raw emotions and fear and everything else. U there is so there's the hypothalamus that controls the pituitary gland that is you know concerned with a lot of our emotional stuff. This whole thing is called the lyic system. So what is happening is in the night all that is getting sorted. Okay. Through the day your limbic system is getting overloaded just through your experiences of the day. Yeah. Yeah. Now in the night a lot of this has to be either got rid of or it has to be stored because in the night the brain has deleted that. Okay. And um so what happens in the night again uh sleep has got two parts. There is uh I I did a podcast with you on sleep. There is the nonm part and there is them part. So uh both have dreams but it's them sleep the dreams and them sleep you know which are which is what we remember you know which again the key part of the subconscious is actually the emotional content. So if you see your dreams you'll notice they always emotionally charged. There is always some emotion tag to it. You know, also our dreams are more visual, less sound. You know, you'll actually see images. You'll you know, it's it's things in motion and but there's always an emotion, right? And of course, now dreams is a separate topic all by itself what it means. Okay. Can I have a go at it until this point just to be sure that I'm with you? Yeah. Uh so effectively, you go through experiences throughout your life, but also every single day. Now all that is cumulatively stored in what we theoretically call the subconscious mind. The subconscious mind originally is a theory from the world of psychology. Yes, it's basically what goes into forming your own human personality and character and it's heavily dependent on your relationship with your parents, all your life's experiences, etc. So you'll hear a lot of modernday psychologists and life coaches saying, "Hey, program your subconscious mind." I think what they're effectively trying to do is feed in positive memory, feed in positive data, feed in positive content so that um in that scrambled egg of memories that you're making, you put in something tasty, something tastier because eventually whatever goes on in your subconscious mind will determine the actions of your conscious mind. Absolutely. Very well said. the ability to work hard or go for that big business that you wanted to open or take that risk in life or ask out that girl. Those are decisions of your conscious mind which are affected heavily by all your memories, your parental relationship, the content you're watching, etc., etc. But in terms of the biology, as of now, we know that yes, the lyic system heavily contributes to affecting your subconscious mind daily through its emotions. through its emotions and every single day your lyic system is getting highly stimulated. When you sleep well at night, your lyic system processes all this and showcases it to your conscious brain as emotionally charged dreams. Absolutely. Effectively coming back to the subconscious mind, I don't think we fully understood the physical nature of the subconscious mind yet. No. So the subconscious mind is not in a spot like see our speech area. I can say there's something called the broka speech area. It's in the left side of the brain. So you can say speech area one part right uh the you know our our say visual area is the occipital lobe. You can say oxipital lobe there. All right. The subconscious mind derives it data or stores it data in all of this. Okay. So you can't isolate you can't take a spot and say this is the subconscious mind. I mean in other words there is no anatomical location for the subconscious mind. There is an anatomical location for other things like our executive decision making our intelligence is in the frontal lobe. Our sensations are in the parietital lobe. Uh below that is the the phalamus which is also a sensory relay station. So all sensations go through through that. Uh so basically all our sensations go through a sensory relay station called the the phalamus which then sends it to the brain. All except smell. That's why smell is a very powerful smell. Smell is the only sensation that bypasses the thealamus and goes straight to the brain. So smell is a very very powerful sensation that is completely ignored in neuroscience but it's very powerful. That's why perfumes play a love and romance. Uh yes play a big role. Uh the practical question for you sir is how does one program the subconscious mind according to you know so the subconscious mind gets programmed by what is what has happened in the conscious mind. So you can't get into the subconscious mind and program it. You can see that the inputs to the subconscious mind through your conscious mind are appropriate which you just said. So if you're going to have happy experiences, if you're going to look at you know everything from the positive side of life all right then over a period of time those things will go into your subconscious. So the subconscious gets it gets its feed from the conscious but it gets stored there for a long time without you even knowing. So right now we are only aware of what's happening in your conscious mind. You're not aware because the subconscious mind has got data stored from since you were a kid. You know my response to the same question is that this is the actual biology behind hey you're an average of the five people you hang out with the most. Absolutely. Or hey your parents' personality reflects in your own nature or hey you are an outcome of the content you consume. Yes. This is completely all these aspects of life program your subconscious mind into operating your conscious mind and taking your life to where it's meant to go. Okay. So obviously if you watch a lot of motivational content, of content around growth, that's who you'll become. And if you watch content that's simply based on entertainment, perhaps it has its place in life. But if it's empty entertainment all the time, it probably leads to some kind of emptiness in terms of your conscious mind's actions perhaps. No, it's very true. I'll just give you example. So when we were in school, we had no environmental sciences. Like when we studied, I think when you were in school, you had EBS, right? So there is a big difference between my approach to the environment and my daughter's. Okay. She is so conscious about everything environmental and we are not conscious at all because in school we never studied it. So in our subconscious there is no environment consciousness. All right. Whereas in your generation it is it's because you were taught that at school. All right. Another another surface level example of this exact thing. We had Suma Garwal ma'am who's one of the country's top nutritionists. She said that uh the country that deals with the least number of obesity issues is Japan and the corollary is that Japanese students are put through a nutrition course in their first and secondary. All school includes nutrition as a core concept. So that's all the subconscious programming. Okay. So the answer to your question is you can't reach the subconscious directly. You have to get to it through your conscious. I think this is perhaps the most important parenting lesson out there as well that you can literally program your kid into being a Taipei personality. Absolutely. Okay, heading into the final section of the episode, the climax, which is the internet's all-time hottest topic, emotions, especially during a period of human kind where emotional instability is the norm. While people say that yes, mental health was an issue even in the '90s, we just didn't call it out. I do think that the nature of urban society in the modern day and from a neuroscience perspective, the way uh dopamine systems are a little messed up in the modern day lead to mental health issues and emotional instability. Mhm. Now starting from these kind of basics, can we take the conversation right up till what the future of emotions is for mankind once computer brain interfaces become a thing. Um in the last section we spoke about the subconscious mind. So I think the audience has loosely understood the subconscious mind. My question to you first and foremost sir is what are emotions? So emotions is a subset of the functioning of the brain. So just like there is memory which is stored there are there is cognition or intellectual functioning or executive actions there is also emotions. The thing about emotions is that there is a feeling attached to it. Normally you know I mean people in general talk of emotions as being connected to the heart but the heart really has no emotions. All the emotions are are in the lyic system. However they are connected to what is happening in the higher brain. Now love is of different types and according to me there is only one real love on the planet and that is that of a mother for her child and the reason for that is that it is unconditional. Okay, not father to child. It is you know mother to child is a very different fathers love their kids as much but a mother having kept the child in the womb for 9 months has a very different subconscious acceptance of the child. The difference between a father's love and a mother's love is a mother's love is unconditional. Father's love is as much but there are expectations. You know mothers tend to have less they you know and and I see this all the time because I deal with children with autism. These are children who cannot speak. read and write, who cannot go to school, who have hyperactive behavior. They have head banging. They have all kinds of things. And I've seen the unconditionality of that love is a different level. Right? So the definition of love is its unconditionality. Everything else is conditional. All right? There is a give and there is a take. So you know it may not be said but it is implied in every other relationship. Now when it comes to emotions I'll start there. There are different levels of emotions again. So I I will deal with the most fundamental one that is that between a man and a woman or between a boy and a girl or emotional love or romantic love or a relationship. I was just classifying it. So this is one. The second is financial. Okay, people have money don't have money. The third is success. People have success, people don't have success. So there are different situations which are emotionally connected. So romantic relationships are money is work is and all of this leads to sadness or happiness. Now the thing is in the brain itself there is an area that's that is referred to as the pleasure area and there's another area which is called the pain area but it's actually not a pain area it's an unpleasure area and these can be stimulated even animals have it. So a famous Russian scientist Pavlov he actually stimulated you can put an electrode into a rat's pleasure area and the rat will you know continue wanting that to the extent of not taking food you know and for the pain here he will do the exact opposite. So we actually have areas in the brain that get triggered by various things. So there's a electrical trigger. There are also chemical triggers. There is dopamine, there is serotinine, there is acetylcholine, there is non-epinephrine, there histamine. There are various uh neurochemicals in the brain that are also responsible for this. Now why are people unhappy? Okay, fundamentally what is it that makes people unhappy? And so there, you know, I could divide them into just a couple of reasons. And in fact addiction has to do with this because when you take addicting when you take things that cause addiction those chemicals and agents go and stick to those areas of the brain. Now the brain cannot get stimulated by anything else. The pleasure area only gets stimulated by the things you are addicted to. So that explains addiction because you know when the pleasure areas are now only only one thing is taken control over them now nothing else gives you pleasure and that that is the cause for addiction. So in other words in the brain they are these two areas. So happiness is actually neurochemistry okay and uh I mean it's uh yeah so neurobiology and neurochemistry both combine like how would you explain happiness to something that's never felt emotions? Okay. No. So when this area is uh is triggered and it has dopamine is a very important part of that you just have a feel you know there is this feel there's this feel good you know there you know there are times when things happen you just feel good it may happen that you've done a great podcast so you just feel good after that and there may be times you've done a podcast and you're not feeling so good you know so there is a part of the brain that gets triggered now different things uh different events different circumstances different people actually trigger your pleasure areas and conversely the opposite. Right? So for the brain, by the way, they are the same. The brain does not make a distinction between the pleasure and the pain areas. For them, it's just two parts. Okay? We are the ones that either feel good or don't feel good. All right? So that that is the distinction. But the fundamental you know if when you analyze it from a neurobiological point of view why is it that people are unhappy. Okay. So one of the reasons is that our brain because of what is happening in the subconscious mind doesn't remain in the present moment. Okay. It is either you know because of what has happened in the past. Either there is a constant triggering of things from the past that make you unhappy and trigger the unpleasure areas. Okay. Or there are fears about what will happen in the future which are also connected to past you know and uh so lower animals actually uh who don't have have a complicated brain like ours are in the moment. They just live in the moment. Okay. There is no past for them. there's no future for them. So one of the problems of humankind is that our brain doesn't let us be still in the moment. You know it's always living in the past or the present again because of the subconscious not the conscious past and the future. Yeah. Again it's the subconscious which is now you know not letting your conscious mind be in this moment. That is reason one. Uh the reason two is a constant gap between what you have and what you want. So humankind there is a constant you know you you want something and you don't have it and so you're unhappy. Now this this could be material possessions, it could be things that you do, it could be emotional pursuits, it could be whatever. And then I often ask myself if it was if it was that simple then when you get it you should be happy, right? I mean so and then I realized that what happens is that the goalpost keeps shifting. M so a person who doesn't have a car might be happy with a simple small car you know the problem is when he gets the small car he's now looking at the midsize car okay and when he gets the midsize car he's looking for a high-end car and when he looking when he has the high-end car he's looking for something even better and I remember Osho you know Rajni when he he was spiritual guru but when he died I believe he had some 80 plus Rolls-Royce cars because his dream was to have one Rolls-Royce car for every day of the year and then I realized that well if a guru was not happy with 80 rulas uh then obviously you know a materi material possessions this trying to bridge this gap doesn't work the other thing is spirituality and meditation which says accept what you have that's the other side whatever you have you accept it well that's easier said than done in today's world because today's world is a materialistic world I I have a bit of a philosophical interjection So there's a story about someone who went up to the Buddha and said, "Buddha, I want happiness." So the Buddha responds by saying, "Remove the eye and you've removed ego. Remove the want and you've removed desire. What you're left with is happiness." And this is effectively the philosophy behind the neuroscience you just explained. Mhm. Yeah. And uh but I have a simple solution for that, you I mean a simple solution in the so there is the spiritual side there's the emotional side and there is the material side right so I did something interesting what I did was when I realized that there is no end that you no matter what you have you are still going to be unhappy uh I did something interesting many years ago um couple of decades I actually you know people look at life ahead what I did is I went to the end of my life you know I said I I reached a point where I said now the time when I part from my body and then I look backwards at my life and I said okay at that point when it is time to leave this body what all should I have been done and had that at that point I can leave stating that you know feeling that I lived a complete life and I actually sat down I took a piece of paper and write down you know it's amazing that list is almost three you know one by one those things are just happening you know I I I put it down on a paper. I've never looked at that paper again. All right. So, I decided that now I'm not going to be craving for anything more. Yeah. I'm just going to I've already decided this is what I want. And it's a one time thing. You know, you do it one time and you let it go. Uh it gives surprisingly it it gives you a very tranquil kind of no wanting anything more in your life feeling. Yeah. Let's speak about tranquility a little bit. Yeah. Coming back to what you said uh about happiness and sadness and the different parts of your brain that are stimulated by either of the two. Yeah. Does there exist neuroscience related to manipulating those two regions? Because I would also assume that too much happiness is also not good. So the pleasure and the pain areas they are separate. They about feel good. All right. Now the tranquility you're talking about is all about balance. Okay. So in our body we so the brain has neurotransmitters for example there's acetylcholine and there's norin nephrine you know one that stimulates you that is responsible for the fight and flight reflex one that calms you down. All right for every chemical in the body there is one which does the exact opposite. And tranquility is all about balance. The universe is all about balance. You know nature if you see is about balance. You know the earth moves around the sun and the moon moves around the earth in beautiful harmonious balance. The tides are in a state of balance. In our body our our chemistry our hormones our our muscles for every if your biceps does one thing there's a tricep that does the exact opposite. So tranquility is not about more or less it is about balance. Okay. of having the right amount of everything. So you're right, just stimulating the pleasure area also can lead to a complete different state of mind. Okay. It can you know you can actually become manic with with uh a whole lot of that that feeling. It's it leads to a hedonistic lifestyle. Exactly. So it's just balance. Everything needs to be balanced. And once you get that life is got to be a state of balance. The word that I use for you equity is a very nice word which is all about balancing out everything. You know once you do that and you respond to situations in life the way they are and not the way you expect them to be. All right? You accept people not the way you want them or not want them to be. You take circumstances in life the way they've happened not the way you would want it to happen. This kind of equity or tranquility or balance which is cons which is directly connected to the neurotransmitters in the brain directly connected to our neurochemistry. This happens. Okay. A hedonistic lifestyle is one where the human body is constantly chasing one or more kinds of pleasures. For example, addiction to intoxicants addiction. um constantly buying new expensive things like being a shopahholic. Effectively, what you're doing is that you're stimulating your own dopamine systems. You're looking for quick dopamine. Effectively, another form of hedonism is just doom scrolling. You know, constantly going through short content. It's constantly secretreting dopamine in your head. But the long-term output of having a hedonistic lifestyle is that you're wrecking your dopamine systems. Right. In in short, can you explain how one is spoiling their dopamine systems by being honestic? Yeah. So again, uh because there is lack of balance now. All right. Uh you are there there are many things in your life. Okay. which would actually give you tranquility balance like concentration on your own health like concentration on relationships like concentrating on uh a harmonious work life balance that will go completely out of twist when the you know when there's an imbalance you're doing too much of see it's like this I'll explain to you like in there's a disease called Parkinson's disease okay now there are two chemicals there acetylcholine and dopamine now what happens in the disease is the dopamine levels fall but the dopamine levels falling don't create a problem it's when they fall the normal level of choline causes symptoms okay did you understand yes so something falls one more thing that falling causes the problems it's not that falling is the normal level of what was balancing out this is what people call hormonal balance exactly yeah so anything in excess anything will cause an imbalance in the neurochemistry of of a of a of our brain. It'll cause imbalance in electrical circuitry of the brain. It'll cause an imbalance between the conscious and the subconscious mind. And then uh you are in a state where you are just not feeling good. You may have everything in the world and still you're not feeling good about life. Gotcha. So effectively what I'm gaining as the bottom line output in order to chase tranquility and not just constant happiness is that you need to make life a little bit difficult for yourself in some aspects. Perhaps it's another way of saying challenge is a must throughout the course of life. Throughout the course of life now and if external challenges don't exist you create the challenges for yourself. Very well said. Could be as simple as sticking to your exercise routine, sleeping on time, meditating every day, something that seems difficult, actually adopting that into your own life. Is that a neuroscience-based hack to chase tranquility? Absolutely. Okay. Now, can you explain the neuroscience of what happens when you invite these good for you challenges into your life? So the moment you invite challenges you're again the balance between acetyloline and nonoprine you actually the moment you invite a challenge you're putting you know if everything is going good for you now there is no challenge in your life so your non-epinephrine levels aren't high moment you bring a challenge you're stimulating this okay norepinephrine norepinephrine all right now in our in our nervous system there is also a a part of a nerve nervous system that some people refer to as the subconscious but is actually referred to as the autonomic nervous system. So there is a nervous system which we have control over. There's a autonomic nervous system which runs the body like which controls your heart rate which controls your digestive movements which a lot of things are happening in your body which you directly can't control. Yogics can do it you know because they have control over the autonomic nervous system but we can't control our autonomic nervous system. Now autonomic nervous system consists of two parts. There is something called the sympathetic nervous system and there is something called the parasympathetic nervous system. Now the sympathetic nervous system has been given by nature to us to do what is called the fight and flight reflex. So when the lion is chasing a deer the deer has to run for life. So at that time what needs to happen? Your blood pressure needs to go up. Your heart rate has to go up. Your pupils have to be dilated. Uh you need more energy. So you need more sugar. Okay. And uh at that time you can't pass stools. So your you know your your bowel movements are shut down. This is controlled by the sympathetic nervous system. What it does it it extracts everything from the body to be able to save your life at that time. There is another system the parasympathetic nervous system which does the exact opposite. It lowers the blood pressure. It calms you down. It lowers your heart rate. It it converts glucon back you know. uh reduces those levels, has your bowel movements going well. The parasympathetic nervous system is the restorative system. It restores the body's harmony. It repairs the tissues. Now, what happens is we have both of these. Nature gave us the sympathetic nervous system to be used once in a while only. But we land up using it all the time when that's why you see all modern diseases hypertension sympathetic diabetes you know constipation muscle spondalo all these conditions are basically because we are using the sympathetic nervous system which was meant to while every day. So all the modern illnesses that we have are because of overstimulation of the sympathetic nervous system being stressed all the time. Being stressed all the time. Now the parasympathetic has the exact opposite. And you know what you have to do to stimulate it? Nothing. Just chill, relax. All right. But we don't do that. In fact, we had done we had done a research project at the scan hospital medical college in the early '90s where we took our own students as subjects staff members and we did uh they were made to undergo just simple yoga every day you know in front over there. So there was no question of compliance and after testing we found it is completely parasympathetic. That means yoga actually stimulates the relaxation system internally. Right? Now, if you're too relaxed and doing nothing, you have over stimulation of the parasympathetic. If you're too stressed, the sympathetic nervous system. Again, coming back to what I said, everything is about balance. So, you need to have both. But for those who are very stressed out working constantly you know u only thinking about their work and the job and not not having a life work balance they have to stimulate the parasympathetic and those who have everything you said need need by creating challenges by you know stretching themselves out a little bit stimulate their sympathetic nervous system so both work in balance we need both these systems to work in balance to be healthy yoga does that intr ically that's why yoga is so useful. Okay. You've effectively given out the biology and mathematics of how one can achieve peace in their human journey. Absolutely. So to summarize, basically your brain has a different part of itself dedicated to pleasure and a different part dedicated to pain over the course of life. They're both going to be stimulated. Yes. Now human understanding especially when you're graduating from school or college is hey let's try chasing pleasure that's how one gets into a hedonistic lifestyle because over the course of life you realize that if I drink this liquid I'll probably get drunk if I smoke this herb I'll probably get high and you're constantly stimulating that many people get stuck in that loop and that's what we call addictions of course can also be placed in the same bracket but life has to be a combination of both pleasure and pain. Now, hypothetically speaking, if you're only chasing pleasure through a hedonistic lifestyle, eventually you won't be able to feel real peace because you're constantly in the chase for external happiness. But the actual goal of human life is tranquility cuz life is going to come at you and you need to be able to respond correctly which will happen out of a tranquil state of mind. And in order to create a tranquil state of mind, there are two requirements. The first requirement is that you have to challenge yourself just a little bit to increase the norepinephrine levels in your bloodstream once in a while or every day. And secondly, to kind of perhaps stimulate that pain part of your brain as well to keep your brain in balance. And the second key point is ensuring that while your sympathetic nervous system is active in the modern day because of daily stressors, you activate your parasympathetic nervous system as well through processes like yoga, stretching, flexibility based movements, regular vacations or simply sleeping really well. Yes, absolutely. Good point to end the podcast because it's a pretty heavy piece. Yeah. I just like to share a little spiritual aspect to this. Sure. I once heard u a saint talk about uh what is it like to live a good life. Okay. He asked and um he said if you have these six things your life becomes worth living. I'll just you know share them with you. Sure. The first thing he said was shanti. Okay. Peace because he said without peace that you can never live a good life. And where how does peace come about? Peace comes about by acceptance. It doesn't come about by agreement. You may not agree with somebody but can you just accept them? It starts with acceptance of you the way you are. Very often we don't accept ourselves the way we are. So first was Shanti and the base of Shanti is acceptance. Then he said shy. So it starts with your body. Okay. If your body is strong, you will be able to combat an infection or a disease. If your body is weak, the disease will win. Second, your mind. If your mind is not strong, people will suppress you. People will make you do their own things. The third thing he said was anund or bliss. So what are the difference between anund and happiness? So happiness is based on something outside of you. You get something good, something happens to you, you're successful, you do something. Anand is an internal state. All right? It is generated from within. It's not dependent on anything from the outside. So the third was Anand. So Shanti, Shaki, Anand. Fourth thing he said was gan. So gan is knowledge. What is the difference between knowledge and information? Information is a fact. And there is so much of it you know all over now on the internet. Gan is that knowledge which you can put to good use. For example, you know the podcast that you do that is actually knowledge that you're sharing with people. So he says very important to separate knowledge from information, right? The fifth thing he said was sunda or beauty. He said we we are naturally happy around beautiful places. Like look at his studio. It's beautiful. You just enter here and you know your sort of alpha waves triggered you know and there are some places where you go and you don't feel the same. So it's very interesting he said that you know the earth the planet if you remove human beings from it there is not a single ugly spot the planet is very beautiful we have messed it up okay so and if you think of some of your most beautiful times it'll be on a beach or a mountain or nature nature is naturally beautiful so starting with beauty of yourself to your home to your office to your surroundings so beauty is a natural state and the sixth last thing he said was p or love and it It is there that he mentioned what I was sharing with you earlier that the true love is that between a mother and a child because it is unconditional right there's no expectation the rest of the kinds of love are outcomes of the subconscious mind subconscious mind exactly and human conditioning and societal condition so and but the most beautiful part is he said all these six things Shanti shi anand gan sundara these are all actually internally generated you know they're internal states And when you live like that, okay, when you when you are like that, the world adjusts around you, you know, no matter what is happening, you you you you remain in that state. So I just found and I actually found a neurobiological base to all of these things. You know, all of these are brain are connected to the brain, you know, all of them. It's all about balancing. Acceptance is a state of balance. you know uh when you're talking of Shanti it is about letting the higher brain have control over the lower brain you know I mean stuff like that so there is a neuroscience base but this was from a spiritual guru I just found it very interesting that if you just be in that state what I found the universe around you sort of uh align aligns itself and the world responds to how you are internally okay doctor thank another epic episode uh for our neuroscience library. So, just want to say thank you for this episode and all our other episodes. We're going to be covering a lot more neuroscience with you over the years. So, deeply grateful and appreciative of your time. Thank you. Thank you, sir. Thank you. That was the episode for today, ladies and gentlemen. Send in your feedback. Send in guest recommendations and tell us what you think of these biology specials on TRS. Absolutely love covering biology. if it's as entertaining as our conversations with Dr. Aloc. Tell us what you like Dr. Aloc and myself to cover the next time around and do tell us what you'd like to see on TRS next. Lots of neuroscience content coming your way. Lots of practical content coming your way. Even beyond just TRS, what I mean by that is something that will unfold over the next few weeks. So stay tuned. Lots of novelty is coming your way.
