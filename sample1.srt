1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,640
61% of people feel expected to just get over stress.

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,800
Yeah, it's like just power through the moment.

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:11,640
CEO of Calm, author of Recharge, David Code.

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,720
Good stress could lead to resilience.

5
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:14,720
You're never really gonna have

6
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,520
a stress-free work environment.

7
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:20,640
Not everything has to be 24-7, 365,

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,320
because at some point you've caused a lot of bad stress.

9
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,760
That's a real kind of indicator for you to say,

10
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,080
I need to really kind of take a hard stop

11
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,080
and figure out how I recharge.

12
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,920

14
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:36,600
Jay Shetty.

15
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,800
The one, the only, Jay Shetty.

16
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,320

Thank you so much for tuning in today.

20
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:53,880
Today I'm so excited because I talked to a really good friend,

21
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:58,040
someone that I respect so highly and admire so deeply.

22
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,400
And I've had the fortune of knowing

23
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,040
for the last couple of years,

24
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm talking about David Code, the CEO of Calm,

25
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,440
the leading app for meditation and mindfulness,

26
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:12,520
and a new author of his book, Recharge,

27
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,960
that offers tips for the best mental wellness practices

28
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,200
in today's digital world.

29
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:22,920
The book has interviews with rappers, rebels, and innovators,

30
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,680
as he travels, talking about stress, burnout,

31
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,160
and feeling drained.

32
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,360

And if you need to recharge,

this book and episode is for you.

38
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,320
Please welcome to On Purpose,

39
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,960
the CEO of Calm, David Code.

40
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,680
David, it's great to have you here.

41
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,160
Thank you, Jay, for having me here today.

42
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,160
I'm so excited.

43
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,880
I'm so excited because I really feel like,

44
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,200
ever since we met, I felt like we hit it off.

45
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:55,960
Right away.

46
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,880
Yeah, right away, right away.

47
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,920
And I've been fortunate enough to have you

48
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,880
interview me so many times,

49
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:06,120
so I'm glad I get to repay the favor this time round.

50
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,240
And I wanted to ask you,

51
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,040
just to get our blood boiling,

52
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,240
just to start with some fun,

53
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,240
and I wanted to ask you, David,

54
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,720
what's something that you're not calm about?

55
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,440
I think there's a lot of things

56
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,160
that I'm not calm about throughout my day.

57
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,640
I will tell you right now,

58
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:27,120
I am in the throes of my oldest daughter

59
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,080
applying to colleges.

60
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:32,320
Even though I try to appear very calm in front of her

61
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,760
and cool and collective, you know?

62
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:37,880
And you don't want to be like a helicopter type of parent.

63
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,640
There are times where I'm just like,

64
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,800
you know, I want to get in there and say something,

65
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,560
but I realize almost like the best thing for her

66
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,400
is for her to go through it.

67
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,600
And I have to kind of take a backseat.

68
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,880
And so it's kind of going from where you take the wheel

69
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,560
to like you're in the passenger seat

70
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,640
and then you're in the backseat

71
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,840
kind of peering every once in a while.

72
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,560
But I can't help myself from like,

73
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,200
I don't know when she first learned to drive

74
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,640
by like saying, oh, I'm stepping on the brake

75
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,560
here and there, right?

76
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:06,080
But that's one thing right now

77
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,080
that is probably a little stressful.

78
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,440
Yeah, no, I can imagine.

79
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:14,080
I read a study that said we process around 72 gigabytes

80
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,400
of information per day,

81
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,200
which the research likened to reading Tolkien's The Hobbit

82
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,200
every single day.

83
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,480
That's nearly 96,000 words.

84
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,480
Right, right.

85
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,000
And you think about that and you go,

86
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,600
no wonder we're overwhelmed.

87
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,920
No wonder we're burnt out.

88
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,160
No wonder we're stressed.

89
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,040
And you have this really brilliant analogy

90
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:37,000
comparing the brain and our mind to a battery.

91
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,520
That's right.

92
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:40,200
Walk us through this because I really like this in your book,

93
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,000
Recharge, the way you break it down and explain it.

94
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,800
You know, the recharge came from a good friend of mine

95
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,800
and we were talking about mental health.

96
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,560
And I just asked her, I said, you know,

97
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,400
how's it going with your kids?

98
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,640
And she goes, you know, I was talking to my kids

99
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,760
and I just said, how's your battery?

100
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,560
And I was like, wait, what?

101
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,880
And she goes, well, I said, how's your battery?

102
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,280
I said, why?

103
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,160
And she said, well, if I ask them how they're doing,

104
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,880
I get the plane fine.

105
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:11,600
And because they're kids, they're just like, I'm fine.

106
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,520
But if I ask them, like, how's your battery?

107
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,080
They're like, well, it's at like 50%

108
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:20,000
or so you may need a snack because they're little.

109
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,200
Or it's at 75% there.

110
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,520
She's like, oh, you're OK.

111
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,160
Or sometimes they're at 25%

112
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:28,080
and they just need something to decompress.

113
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,440
While we were talking about it, a light bulb just went out.

114
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,840
And that light bulb that went on was about like,

115
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,720
she took something that at times can be charged

116
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,640
and she took something and really simplified in a way

117
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:43,320
that I think we would all understand, regardless of age.

118
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,920
And I asked her, I was like, can I run with that?

119
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,280
And she was like, yeah, sure, whatever, right?

120
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,160
And we still laugh about it, Brenda and I,

121
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,720
because she's like, wow, you actually took it.

122
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,160
And I was like, yeah, I used it as a theme.

123
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,640
I talk about it.

124
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,560
I go to clients.

125
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,920
I go out and it just kind of resonates with people

126
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,320
because it's simple.

127
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,400
And it doesn't kind of draw out any emotions.

128
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,800
It just says like, hey, how's your battery?

129
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,120
How are you feeling?

130
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,320
And I think that sometimes that gets lost

131
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,800
because we try to make it bigger sometimes than it is.

132
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,920
And it's really nice when you can kind of just simplify it

133
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,600
and just ask you, how's your battery?

134
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,240
How are you doing?

135
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,000
I love the question, how's your battery,

136
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,880
even more than how you're doing, like you said.

137
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:28,360
Because I think sometimes we, I think you also mentioned

138
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,680
that we can scale everything up to a 10.

139
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,280
That's right.

140
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,880
So everything can feel like it's a 10, it's the worst.

141
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,840
Or everything can feel like, oh, it's just plain old fine.

142
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,480
That's right.

143
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,560
And then you don't have much to play with.

144
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,680
Whereas when you get a number, walk us through the different

145
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,400
breakdowns as you do in the book.

146
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:44,880
Yeah.

147
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,200
Because I think when you look at zero to a hundred,

148
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,800
we're very good at feeling zero and maybe a hundred, right?

149
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,880
Like if it's your kid's wedding, chances are you'll be at a hundred.

150
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,680
If it's like your kid's birthday, like you're at a hundred.

151
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,200
Like there's these joyful, blissful moments in life

152
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,400
that people experience and we go, yeah, that was a hundred moment.

153
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,640
And then we all know what a zero moment feels like.

154
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:11,680
You lost a loved one who sadly passed away.

155
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,320
You got, you know, you lost your job.

156
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,800
Like there's these very zero moments.

157
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,760
Walk us through how you break down the zero to a hundred.

158
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,760
Yeah. And I tried to do it really simply.

159
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:25,200
You know, I have found, and I'll talk about my own kids at times.

160
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,640
When I asked them that question, how their battery is,

161
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,720
I noticed that they check, like most people,

162
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,080
they check their phones quite often.

163
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,800
And at some point it just becomes like a reflex

164
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,800
and they don't even know they're checking it.

165
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,520
But when they do look at it and the power's down

166
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,920
or it goes yellow or it goes red, they get a little panicked.

167
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,200
Like, oh my God, I got to charge it.

168
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,960
Imagine my surprise when we're in like airports

169
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,560
and they're like going out to people,

170
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,720
can I use a little of your charge, right?

171
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,680
I think we've all been there.

172
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,440
We don't have a charger and usually like,

173
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,400
I need something.

174
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,360
Can somebody help me out?

175
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,080
Most times people are really kind and they'll just,

176
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,920
you know, kind of help you, especially if you're a kid.

177
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,280
I thought about then putting it into zones

178
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,880
and I put it into four zones.

179
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,760
And I just said, you know, if you're at 75 to 100,

180
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,360
you're probably fine.

181
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,720
And meaning that, you know, you're in a zone

182
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,840
where you're just moving along.

183
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:22,400
If you're at 50 to 75, you're probably in a place

184
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,280
where you might need to start to think about

185
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,280
how you may want to recharge.

186
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,240
If you're in that 25 to 50,

187
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,120
it's time to start figuring out, take a break.

188
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,560
You may need to take a walk.

189
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,560
You may need to put down the phone.

190
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,440
You may need to stop the litany of Zoom calls

191
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,800
that you're on right now, right?

192
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,760
And if you find yourself zero to 25,

193
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,880
that's a real kind of indicator for you to say,

194
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,880
hey, something's probably not right.

195
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,480
And I need to really kind of take a hard stop

196
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,080
and figure out how I recharge.

197
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,480
And recharge can happen in a number of different ways.

198
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,840
And so I've often talked about

199
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,280
when I've gotten into that zone,

200
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,760
I just kind of almost go for a walk.

201
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,160
I sometimes go outside.

202
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,760
I take some deep breaths.

203
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,440
I do a number of things.

204
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,800
Sometimes I may need a workout.

205
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,680
A workout really helps me to recharge on a personal front.

206
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,080
And everyone's a little bit different

207
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,760
and they'll go to different techniques.

208
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,760
And so in the book, I list a lot of things

209
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,960
in the book that you may do.

210
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,080
You may do one, two, three, four, or all of them.

211
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,320
And they're just really techniques

212
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,320
for you to figure out what works for you.

213
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,600
Yeah, no, and I really like that breakdown

214
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,680
because I think we're all better

215
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,440
when we're measuring things with numbers.

216
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:35,840
That's right.

217
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,120
There's a specificity there.

218
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:37,760
Yeah, yeah.

219
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,040
And I'm one of those people,

220
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:41,440
I think the way your phone is charged

221
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,280
says so much about you as a person.

222
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,200
So my phone is always charged.

223
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:45,680
Yeah.

224
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:50,320
I'm very rarely below 30% or 40% on my phone.

225
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:54,080
And I think I try and monitor my personal health

226
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,120
in a similar way.

227
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:55,600
Right.

228
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,080
As soon as I feel myself going below 50%,

229
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,120
I know it's time for an early night.

230
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,680
I know it's time to cancel weekend plans.

231
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,560
I canceled a dinner this evening for that exact reason.

232
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:06,960
Mm-hmm.

233
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,640
I got back from work yesterday.

234
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,160
I left, I started work yesterday at like 8.30 a.m.

235
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,680
and I got back from a shoot at 9.30 p.m.

236
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,320
And I knew I had a dinner tonight.

237
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,440
And I just said, I'm so sorry, I can't make it.

238
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:21,920
Good for you.

239
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,280
Because I knew I had a busy day today.

240
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:23,920
I was interviewing you.

241
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,440
I was interviewing another guest.

242
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,280
And I was like, I want to be really present for that.

243
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,120
It's really critical stuff.

244
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,920
And then I need to recharge using your word.

245
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,520
I need to recharge this evening.

246
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,600
And I'm always shifting things to recharge.

247
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,720
And I love that idea because I think we hear the word rest.

248
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,040
And then sometimes we feel guilty.

249
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,400
We shouldn't, but we feel guilty.

250
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,840
Like, I don't have time to rest.

251
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,400
Yeah.

252
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,240
But when you think of it about recharging,

253
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,800
you're reframing it and going, oh, I do need to recharge.

254
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,360
Because otherwise, how am I going to give my best tomorrow?

255
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,080
100%.

256
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:54,640
100%.

257
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,920
And you know, it's funny.

258
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,680
You and me are the same on batteries.

259
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,920
I keep my battery pretty charged as well.

260
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,680
I have an electric car too.

261
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,520
I marvel at people who could take that electric car battery down to 5%.

262
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,320
I can't do it.

263
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,080
That stresses me out.

264
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,240
I'm stressed out when they tell me these stories.

265
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,920
Oh, I took the battery down to 5%.

266
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,600
I'm like, seriously?

267
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,240
How?

268
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,840
I mean, and they're like, oh, it's fine.

269
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,000
And for some people, it works, right?

270
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,440
For me, that doesn't work.

271
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,520
I'm plugging in that battery every night.

272
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,160
And I'm going to make sure I charge that battery up.

273
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,680
Others will let it go pretty low.

274
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,040
Everyone's a little bit different.

275
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:27,920
That works for them.

276
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,520
I've asked some of my friends who charge it go really low.

277
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:34,240
And they're like, well, if I charge it too much, I get stressed.

278
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,800
I'm like, oh, OK, it can work the other way.

279
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,680
Interesting.

280
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:42,000
So it's got to kind of work for you and how you want to recharge

281
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
and different techniques that you want to do.

282
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,800
You're never really going to have a stress-free work environment.

283
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,000
Anxiety, depression, and then starts to lead to physical ailments

284
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,920
because we know there's a linkage.

285
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,800
Good stress could lead to resilience.

286
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,320
It could lead to growth.

287
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,640
It actually could lead to a stronger culture.

288
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,800
I was wondering if someone's at a zero,

289
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,400
when you ask them, how's your battery?

290
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:02,960
Yeah.

291
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:06,480
And if someone says, I'm at five and I'm talking about emotionally,

292
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,480
mentally, not their car or their phone,

293
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,880
what would you say to them?

294
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:15,520
How would you communicate with them some of these tools

295
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:16,720
when you're at zero?

296
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:21,280
I've learned to, like, take the space to give them space

297
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,360
so we can actually have a proper conversation.

298
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,440
If you find someone at a really low percentage,

299
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,760
and I may ask that person, like, how are you doing?

300
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,440
How are you feeling? And most of the time, you just want a,

301
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,920
I'm good, because then you just want to keep going.

302
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,040
And I find that often in the business world as well,

303
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,200
not just in the personal world, but in the business world.

304
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,520
We don't want a response,

305
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,360
or sometimes we don't have the time to be like,

306
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,560
if that person who you're asking the question to says,

307
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,680
I'm not doing so hot and I'm not doing so well,

308
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,400
then what do you do?

309
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,400
So I'm very intentional when I ask some of these questions

310
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,720
to individuals so that I give,

311
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,840
I'm ready for that response if it's, I'm not doing well,

312
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,760
like a 5%. So I kind of want to frame it there.

313
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,560
I love that. Yeah.

314
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,880
I think sometimes you rush through these conversations.

315
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,080
And then when they do tell you they're a 5 or a 10,

316
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,160
I think the best things that I have found

317
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,520
is you have to be present for them.

318
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:16,960
You have to listen.

319
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,960
You do such a brilliant job at that, Jay,

320
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,600
because even in this type of environment,

321
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,680
we know as we have this one-to-one conversation,

322
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,480
if I was telling you I was a 5 or a 0,

323
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,200
you'd be all in on this and you would hear me out.

324
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,960
And then you would start to tell me,

325
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,440
okay, let's talk about what's causing that.

326
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,680
And I've had at times where family members have come to me and said,

327
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,120
hey, I'm at a 5.

328
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,840
And we start to break it down.

329
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,840
And I said, let me put it in another way for you.

330
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,280
Think about your phone.

331
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,600
And we do checks on our phone.

332
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,800
And there's things on your phone that drain your battery

333
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,160
more than other applications.

334
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,400
And they're like, yeah, it's like when you go and

335
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:57,120
Apple shows you what's draining or taking up all your memory.

336
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,080
And what happens when you start to delete some of those things?

337
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,080
Or what happens when you start to recognize what's causing it?

338
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:06,960
They're like, oh, my battery is much more efficient.

339
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,080
And I'm like, yeah.

340
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:11,760
So what's causing that in your personal life right now?

341
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,400
Yeah.

342
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:16,160
And we try to create like, you know, analogies of different things.

343
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:21,280
And so it doesn't become a space where all we're doing is talking about all the negativity.

344
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:24,960
We're trying to draw parallels to different things in everyday life.

345
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:28,640
And so that it doesn't become such a charged conversation.

346
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:28,960
Yeah.

347
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,280
Right.

348
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:32,240
And that's kind of the recharge concept as well, where we're like,

349
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,320
let's talk, let's talk about your mental health.

350
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,040
Because sometimes some people don't want to talk about their mental health.

351
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:37,600
Mm-hmm.

352
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,880
But when we bring up the battery conversation or how to recharge,

353
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,640
it's just a different framing.

354
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:46,400
And again, this is something I think you just do brilliantly to bring everyone in.

355
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,920
And I try to do the same thing there as well.

356
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:50,160
Yeah.

357
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,880
I was going to ask you that, actually, because I've always felt that with you.

358
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:57,600
You've always been present at different touch points, whether we're at dinners, events,

359
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,760
even when we've traveled and seen each other when we're in New York for a dinner,

360
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,040
for time earlier this year.

361
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,360
You're always present, too.

362
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,360
And I wonder, how do you do that as a busy CEO?

363
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,840
Because I think you're so right that when we ask the question, how are you doing,

364
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,960
we are subconsciously hoping someone just says, I'm good.

365
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:23,600
We are all, we almost ask the question and expect the response even before we have a response.

366
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,240
You're so right.

367
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,760
Like, that really resonated with me.

368
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,560
And the truth is, sometimes life is fast for most of us, right?

369
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,720
Our schedules are back to back to back.

370
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:38,400
We are running from dropping your kid to school, running to work, picking up the laundry,

371
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,160
doing the laundry, whatever, right?

372
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,280
There's so much going on.

373
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:47,040
How do you actually create space for these conversations?

374
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,720
And that's part of being a lot more present and intentional.

375
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:55,360
As leaders, and I'd be curious now for you as CEO as well,

376
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,160
we're expected to have all the answers.

377
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:01,840
We're expected to make many different types of decisions.

378
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,920
We're expected to play roles in HR, but also company strategy.

379
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,440
And, you know, when you take a step back, you can't make every decision.

380
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,280
And then there's always things that don't, that are the unexpected.

381
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,040
Take your car analogy.

382
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,800
So when you had your car and you were at 30%, you were probably with someone.

383
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,440
But in the back of your mind, you're going, how am I going to get home?

384
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,120
Where am I going to charge?

385
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:28,480
And you could do this probably better than most, but you still want to be present for that

386
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,240
individual that you're with or your friends that you're with in those conversations.

387
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:36,880
And what I find is like, sometimes we as leaders have to make the space.

388
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:43,200
Sometimes we as leaders have to show something that you do absolutely brilliantly is to show

389
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,320
a vulnerable side to them and talk about our own stories.

390
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,560
I find that many CEOs today aren't vulnerable.

391
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,680
I, for one, was not very good at being vulnerable.

392
00:15:54,240 --> 00:16:02,480
When I wrote the book though, I was just taken back at how many people who I met for the first time

393
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,320
were so open and honest and vulnerable with myself.

394
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:11,520
And it got me thinking, well, if they can do it, why can't I do it?

395
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:12,560
Right?

396
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:19,280
And if I started to show some of that vulnerability at work, if I started to give a little bit of space

397
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:25,840
and more time for that conversation, would that then make it just more open for others

398
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,480
and more safe for others to have the conversation?

399
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:33,120
Because if I, if I'm not having that conversation and saying, here's my own journey,

400
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,600
then they may feel that it's not okay for them to open up as well.

401
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:38,400
Right?

402
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,200
I just be curious, like you as CEO, right?

403
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,520
You're, I mean, you've got all these different businesses.

404
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,040
How do you do that with your own employees?

405
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:49,360
Yeah, I think it's a, for me, it comes to the balance.

406
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,280
So vulnerability is a great point.

407
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:57,360
And, and I really appreciate that because I do agree that if you create space to share

408
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,600
what you're going through with your teams, they then have the permission to do the same.

409
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:07,120
And I think I was mentioning when we did a panel at Calm Coast a month ago or so,

410
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:13,920
I was talking about a client of mine that I was coaching, who's the CEO of a very large corporation.

411
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:19,040
And we'd gone through a transformation. They were saying to me, Jay, I'm, you know,

412
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:22,000
I'm feeling good. And I was like, great. Well, you should tell your team about your journey.

413
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,280
And they were like, how can I tell them?

414
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:23,680
Right.

415
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:26,080
And I said, what do you mean? And they said, well, if I tell them,

416
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,320
they're going to think I'm weak. And I was like, no, I promise you,

417
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:29,600
they're going to think you're strong.

418
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:35,920
And I think we're still redefining and reframing strength in the world today.

419
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:42,880
I think there are some of us who still see bravado and arrogance and chauvinism as being strong.

420
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:47,120
And I think that's shifting, but it's shifting very slowly.

421
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,640
That's right.

422
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:56,640
It is a cultural expectation as well, societal expectation of strength being this kind of facade.

423
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,640
But I think a lot of us are now realizing, well, no,

424
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:03,200
strength is being able to show both sides and open up and be vulnerable.

425
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:08,160
I think the other thing that really comes to mind when I'm thinking about being CEO is,

426
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,840
I think stress can make people work harder,

427
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,640
but it's the right amount of stress that makes someone work better.

428
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,600
So good. So true.

429
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,520
Right? There's a spectrum of stress.

430
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,320
So true, so good.

431
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,640
If I just keep checking in with someone and go, have you done it yet?

432
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,960
Are you done yet? Why are we not there yet? Why did the numbers not triple this?

433
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:30,320
If I do that, they're going to feel stressed and they may work harder,

434
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,600
but that doesn't mean they work better.

435
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,160
That's right.

436
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,760
And so to me, the right amount of stress, and I want to ask you this as well,

437
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:41,440
talk to me about the difference between good stress and bad stress and how you've been able

438
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,400
to harness the right amount when you've got it right.

439
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:49,600
In the book, actually, I interviewed Dr. Aditi Nurikar and you met her.

440
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,560
Yeah. She's wonderful.

441
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,520
Fantastic. Right.

442
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,600
And we got into this whole conversation of good stress, bad stress.

443
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,600
You stress, good stress versus bad stress, distress.

444
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:05,760
And, you know, we talked about how good stress could lead to resilience.

445
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,280
It could lead to growth.

446
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,280
It actually could lead to a stronger culture.

447
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:13,280
You're never really going to have a stress-free work environment.

448
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:13,840
Agreed.

449
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,600
You know, we're always going to have stress at work.

450
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,440
We're all going to have deadlines.

451
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,920
We're all going to have things we're going to want to hit.

452
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:26,000
But not everything has to be, just like you said, 24-7, 365.

453
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:31,920
Because at some point, it's going to stack so much that you as a leader are realizing you're

454
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,440
probably not being very efficient.

455
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:38,480
Your employees are probably not working super efficiently, not working well together.

456
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,000
And they're probably, you've caused a lot of bad stress, distress in their life.

457
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,320
That's leading to things like anxiety, depression, and then starts to lead to physical ailments.

458
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:52,160
Because we know there's a linkage between, you know, your mental health and your physical health.

459
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:56,080
And so that becomes a very vicious cycle, especially in the workplace.

460
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,040
And that leads to a lot of unproductivity.

461
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:04,560
What I've found with the two is you really have to find that right balance and understand there

462
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,960
will be, and just talk about it.

463
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:07,680
There's a push.

464
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,800
We're all going to make a push.

465
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:14,400
We did it recently as a company at Calm around the elections.

466
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:20,000
And we treated the elections like our Super Bowl moment because we knew, and we saw the data,

467
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,760
that people's stress was rising every day as that day, November 5th, got closer and closer.

468
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,800
We saw it in the App Store.

469
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,760
We saw it in comments.

470
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,520
We saw it on social.

471
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:35,200
So we really came together as a company to do different types of things around that.

472
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,160
Take a breath, 30 seconds or 15 seconds of silence.

473
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:44,240
We showed animals from the San Diego Zoo on Instagram.

474
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,800
And we got so many people commenting that day that said, hey, thank you for the silence.

475
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:55,120
Thank you for my 15 seconds in this world where so many things are happening.

476
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,800
Now, people were dialing in from work because they were stressed at work.

477
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,480
Stress doesn't just mean it's at home.

478
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,280
It was like people were like during the elections coming in from work.

479
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:07,920
And so we wanted to give them a little bit so they had a release so they could be more productive.

480
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:14,080
So there's a lot of things around stuff that I look at for good stress and bad stress and recognize

481
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:18,800
there's always going to be a push-pull, but that's the part where you can't do it alone.

482
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:19,760
You got to have a good team.

483
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:20,720
You got to talk about it.

484
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:26,480
You do this so well and make sure that becomes part of your fabric, your culture, your DNA.

485
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,800
And I think it's shifting, but it's slow.

486
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,440
Yeah.

487
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,480
I think the conversation around mental health in everyday life,

488
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,720
it's the most approachable it's ever been, right?

489
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,680
I talk about things with my own kids today around mental health.

490
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:46,560
When I was a child coming, you know, I'd be curious, like for you, like immigrant family,

491
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:50,080
we didn't talk about our mental health in my household, right?

492
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:54,000
We talked more about powering through things and I can talk about that later,

493
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,440
but we didn't really talk about it.

494
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,680
My kids talk about it. They may overuse it at times, not use it the right way.

495
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,640
It's okay. They're having the conversation.

496
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,360
Their friends are having the conversation. I think that's great.

497
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:10,480
But when you go to the workplace, it kind of stops, you know?

498
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,760
And I go to so many places and I'm like, do you talk about your mental health at work?

499
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,400
And they're like, no.

500
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,280
And I'm like, well, let's change that dialogue.

501
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:21,120
Let's make it as approachable as it is in everyday life.

502
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,560
And how do we start to do that? Let's give you the tools and we'll start at the top.

503
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,160
Yeah, you're so right. You're so right.

504
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:32,080
What you're painting a picture of for me is that I look at the good stress being

505
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,640
when we all know what challenge we're up against.

506
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,800
We know what the goal is and everyone feels supported.

507
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:43,680
And I think what often happens is people don't know what the goal is

508
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,680
because you're not helping them do that.

509
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:48,720
They only see the challenge and they don't feel supported.

510
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,440
That's right.

511
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:54,080
So now they don't know where they're going and they feel if they fall flat on their face,

512
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,360
they have nothing to catch them.

513
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,160
That's right.

514
00:22:56,160 --> 00:23:00,640
As a leader, the goal is to provide the goal and the support.

515
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,720
And then the person can focus on the challenge.

516
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,120
Yeah. And be transparent in that journey.

517
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:09,600
You know, I speak to many CEOs in the Valley and over the world.

518
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:14,160
And, you know, a lot of times I'll ask them, how do you prioritize things with your employees?

519
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,760
How transparent are you?

520
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,320
And I'll tell you, many of them are not that transparent.

521
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:20,240
Or they'll be like, these are the most important things.

522
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,240
And then they'll add five more and then five more.

523
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,600
Right. And I'll be like, oh, okay.

524
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,520
What did you take away?

525
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,360
And they're like, what are you talking about?

526
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,680
I mean, what did you take away?

527
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,880
And they're like, nothing.

528
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,400
And I'm like, well, how do you think that's affecting your employees?

529
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,120
And they're like, I never really thought about that.

530
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:46,800
So I've just compounded and stacked the problem as a leader.

531
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:53,600
And you didn't take anything away and it cascades down like a megaphone.

532
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:59,040
Think about what that employee is going through and walk in their shoes for a minute.

533
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:05,040
You know, we at the top have the luxury of having more control over our schedules.

534
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,800
But that person may not have as much control over their schedule.

535
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,480
They're just ticking through things.

536
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:10,960
Yeah.

537
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:16,240
And if you just keep adding and not taking certain things away and saying, this is important.

538
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,360
This isn't important.

539
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,400
Here's how I think about it.

540
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,760
Here's how I'm being transparent.

541
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,240
You're adding more stress to your company.

542
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,200
You know, leaders struggle with how to be vulnerable.

543
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,560
Is it going to be used against me?

544
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,040
Yeah.

545
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,360
Is someone going to write about it and say I'm too weak?

546
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,480
Is the board going to think I'm weak as a leader?

547
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:36,800
That's ultimately also a fail of corporate stewardship.

548
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,520
Because they have to also look after your mental health.

549
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,120
At Calm, I love this.

550
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:46,400
When I first got introduced to Calm and started taking calls with the teams

551
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:50,640
and I took my role of chief purpose officer, I got integrated into the culture.

552
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:56,880
I loved the little things and the focus on the little things at meetings at Calm,

553
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,880
whether they're on Zoom, in person.

554
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:04,240
I want to hear about these smaller things that are happening on a daily basis.

555
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,840
Because I think often companies think they need to put out a thing that says,

556
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:11,360
we're focusing on company mental health and they're doing these big things.

557
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:16,320
But Calm internally, let alone the work they do with other companies and workplaces,

558
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:23,040
but Calm internally had some really nice cultural things that I noticed from the outside in

559
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,720
as I was being integrated.

560
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:28,640
Walk us through some of those daily things that you think create the rituals and practices

561
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:29,840
that help people.

562
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:35,360
It was interesting for me, my first day at Calm, I walk in and they're Michael and Alex,

563
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,880
who you know well, the founders, right?

564
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,520
Yeah, I love them.

565
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,720
And they love you and they talk about you all the time and how you all first met.

566
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:46,960
And they introduced me to the company, warm welcome, so inviting.

567
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:51,040
And they started the whole all hands off with a meditation.

568
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,920
And I wasn't really used to that.

569
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:59,920
You know, and I was I was kind of sitting there and I kind of noticed everyone.

570
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:02,160
And normally we listen to someone like yourself.

571
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:06,000
We'll turn you on or we'll turn one of our other kind of narrators on.

572
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:06,720
They do great.

573
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:09,520
And everyone just kind of sat there in the moment.

574
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,560
And whether it was sometimes it's, you know, really quick, 30 seconds,

575
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,960
sometimes it's five, six minutes, something three minutes.

576
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:20,160
And they listened and it was and I kind of was peeking at times looking.

577
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:24,000
I'm like, is everyone kind of closing their eyes, you know, around here, you know, looking there.

578
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,480
And they were just in the moment.

579
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,440
It was a moment for me that showed me how much they cared.

580
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,840
And I was like, wow, this company cares.

581
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,840
This isn't forced.

582
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:34,960
You don't have to be here.

583
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,480
You don't have to do this.

584
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,120
And they were there and they were present and they were in the moment.

585
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:40,960
So that's like some of this.

586
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,680
That was one of the ways I knew this company was going to be different.

587
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:50,880
And then I watched as the company did things around gratitude, where we end every all hands

588
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:51,680
with gratitude.

589
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:57,680
We read things that have come into us and it's a reminder of the impact we're having.

590
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:04,720
And I think that's why sometimes I'm so stressed because I feel this weight of responsibility

591
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:08,160
where every second of every day someone is using the product.

592
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:15,280
And I just feel like if we're not answering them or not helping them in the moment,

593
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,960
someone's not getting something that they need.

594
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:21,040
And I feel that stress and I feel the response.

595
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,240
It's really responsibility.

596
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:22,560
Yeah.

597
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,880
And I talk about that with the employees.

598
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,360
And I think it's really important to talk about that.

599
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,120
So we do the gratitude piece at the end.

600
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:35,120
We have zoom free days, you know, where I talk to employees about,

601
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:40,400
hey, if you're in a moment where you find yourself in five zooms, take a beat.

602
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,080
You don't need to do that.

603
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:45,360
And if there's meetings that don't make sense, just like you did tonight, which was great.

604
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,840
Just say, no, it's okay.

605
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,360
You know, we'll figure it out.

606
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:50,880
And I do that too.

607
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:56,000
And I try to be a lot more purposeful now because it helps me then be more present

608
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,600
in the meetings that I need to be in.

609
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,000
Yeah.

610
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:58,720
Right.

611
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,400
And rather than saying, it's not the quantity of meetings that I'm in,

612
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,720
it's those quality of meeting moments that I'm in.

613
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:12,320
And I think people sometimes like misinterpret like quantity for productivity versus like value.

614
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:18,160
And I'm much more like, okay, I'm going to do, I'm going to focus on quality.

615
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,120
And it may mean less.

616
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,240
And that doesn't have to sacrifice my impact.

617
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,720
I was going to ask you, how does it impact productivity?

618
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:29,280
And I do think that we've convinced ourselves that if I'm doing more,

619
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:33,440
if there's more on my schedule, if I'm jumping around, we've created

620
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:39,520
our definition of value to be around busyness, right?

621
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,320
Yes.

622
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:44,800
And we all feel we're more important, valuable, and it's subconscious.

623
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:48,720
Again, you just think, oh yeah, if I've got a lot to do, then I must be doing something.

624
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,280
Yeah.

625
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,360
How do we start to shift that conversation?

626
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,800
What have you learned about that?

627
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:56,240
I know you interviewed some amazing people as well, as you were saying inside the book.

628
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:00,080
What did you learn about how we can reframe what we believe makes us valuable?

629
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:00,880
Yeah, yeah.

630
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:07,360
So I had, so two people in particular, so John Scully, for example, the former CEO of Apple,

631
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:12,000
he talked about how in the book he was chief listening officer.

632
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,160
And I was like, really?

633
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:14,880
And he's like, yeah.

634
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,800
Like Steve asked that we make our own business cards.

635
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,680
And I wrote chief listening officer.

636
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:25,680
And I sat there and I was like, wow, that's, that was great.

637
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,600
You listen.

638
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:32,000
And so, because so often, you know, you just start talking.

639
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:39,760
And he's like, no, I became a lot more purposeful if I just listened first, said probably less.

640
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:44,960
But that impact was greater because I heard what was happening and I thought that was great.

641
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,920
I had Jack Rowe, who's a former CEO of Aetna in the book, he came over and he said,

642
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,280
sometimes you have to put yourself into neutral.

643
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:57,760
And he's like, and you have to give yourself space because you can't run at 100 miles an hour.

644
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:03,280
And if you don't give yourself a little bit of a break, no matter what position you're in,

645
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:09,680
you're going to find yourself upside down and you're not going to figure out how to turn back up.

646
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:16,720
And I appreciated those conversations with them because they're a little bit more old school in

647
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,360
their approach.

648
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:21,200
They think we're a little bit more in the middle now.

649
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,240
And then there's a younger generation, right, that's coming up with things about things completely

650
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:29,680
different. It's been such a privilege to be able to kind of talk to so many different people

651
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:34,400
who are in that continuum to kind of hear how they're managing it, right?

652
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:37,920
Even like how you think about things today and how you manage all that, right?

653
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:41,920
It just must be a lot coming at you today from many different angles when they're like,

654
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,040
Jay, what do you do?

655
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:48,800
Yeah, yeah. And I think for me, it is the old cliche, but it's so true.

656
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,640
Like you are only as good as your team.

657
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:55,040
And I do think being a leader means taking care of your team.

658
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,000
That's right.

659
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,480
In one sense, I feel like that's all a leader actually has to do is be the coach,

660
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:05,680
therapist, support system or provide and bring those things in for the team.

661
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,600
And you almost become a coach.

662
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,000
Right.

663
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,520
And yes, you're being strategic.

664
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,880
Yes, you're being a visionary.

665
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:16,000
But a lot of it is just loving people and supporting people.

666
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,760
I find at least, I find like that's what most of my time is taken up.

667
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,480
100%.

668
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,280
Doing because everyone has their emotions.

669
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,600
And as long as you have smart people that you're working with,

670
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:30,000
then those people are the people that investing in them as humans.

671
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:30,480
Yeah.

672
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,640
Is allowing them to do what you trust them to do.

673
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,200
That's right.

674
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:37,760
But the thing that's holding them back is usually something emotional or mental.

675
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,000
It's rarely professional that people have challenges.

676
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,880
And I find it's something they're going through in their personal life.

677
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,120
It's a mental block that they have.

678
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:45,920
Yeah.

679
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:49,280
And if that doesn't get healed and accessed in the workplace,

680
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,840
that's going to be the spanner in the works.

681
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:55,680
Like that's going to be the thing that bottlenecks the process,

682
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,640
creates inefficiency, creates a lack of trust.

683
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,120
That's right.

684
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,800
That's the kind of stuff that gets in the way.

685
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:01,200
Yeah.

686
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,920
And a lot of times too, when you talk to people,

687
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:06,640
they have no idea what's happening outside the workplace.

688
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,360
Mm-hmm.

689
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:11,760
You know, but so much that happens outside the workplace affects the workplace.

690
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:17,200
It's really important for companies too, to have mental health support tools for employees.

691
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,240
So when they need things, people to talk to, you know, applications,

692
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:23,360
whether they're calm or others, therapy, if they need it,

693
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:28,000
if they just make those available and known, that's another step in the process.

694
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:28,240
Yeah.

695
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,560
So that's why I always tell people, it's not just one thing.

696
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:33,120
It's kind of like a number of things you have to put together,

697
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,920
because people may take bits and pieces of each to make it their own.

698
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,440
But it kind of shows them when they need it, it's there.

699
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:39,760
Yeah.

700
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,480
And a lot of times people will go look for things on their own.

701
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,520
You know, they'll search and they'll see if you got tools and what companies.

702
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:49,200
And I do find that you sometimes will lose good people

703
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,520
because you're not supporting them in their journey.

704
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:51,920
Yeah.

705
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:56,720
And so the more you could be there for them and they know that,

706
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:01,760
they become some of your most loyal, most productive,

707
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:05,280
most culture bearing, you know, carrying the flag employees.

708
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:05,600
Yeah.

709
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,800
And you didn't have to tell them to do it.

710
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,400
They just kind of did it on their own.

711
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,120
Absolutely.

712
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,680
And I feel like those often are the best ones.

713
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:15,040
And I, and we have a lot of those.

714
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:19,120
And I'm very, and I just feel very privileged that we have so many folks like that,

715
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:22,480
that they just care deeply and it's personal for them.

716
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:26,400
My previous company I had started was a caregiving company.

717
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:32,080
And one thing I noticed in that company was that so many people that were caring for

718
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:35,040
others were suffering, right?

719
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:40,560
They, and then they had to go to work and people had no idea that they were doing like five jobs,

720
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,920
caregiver, they were worrying about their finances.

721
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:46,000
They were trying to figure out how they help people.

722
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,600
And then they had to go to work and, and they had a litany of things they had to go do.

723
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:53,120
And most people have no idea all these things are going on in their people's lives,

724
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:53,280
right?

725
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,800
Because sometimes we just don't ask the question.

726
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:59,280
And because we're so busy ourselves, or sometimes we don't want to ask the question

727
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:01,680
because we're so busy ourselves, we can't take anything else off.

728
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:09,040
But I just feel that if we are just more aware and we create space for employees and we listen to

729
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:12,800
what they have to say, flexible work schedules, what are they asking for?

730
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,200
That's why I constantly poll our employees as well.

731
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:16,800
What do you value?

732
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,880
And they'll tell us.

733
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:23,120
And then if we have stuff that they don't want, we put it away.

734
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:25,920
I sometimes like, oh, all my employees want this gym membership.

735
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,520
And then nobody uses it.

736
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,680
And, and they're like, just ask.

737
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:32,240
Yeah.

738
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:37,120
And I'm like, now I just ask, let's have our team go out and say, here are the top 10 things.

739
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:37,840
What do you want?

740
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:38,560
Yeah.

741
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:41,520
And then we'll take away a couple of things that they don't use, you know,

742
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,240
and we'll try to ask that almost every year.

743
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:44,800
Totally.

744
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,560
I, I, I couldn't agree more.

745
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,720
We, I love gift giving.

746
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,000
It's one of my love languages.

747
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,600
And you were so kind to bring me a gift today, which was very thoughtful

748
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:57,760
and very useful and both of which I will use.

749
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:01,120
And the reason I'm saying that is I love giving gifts too.

750
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:05,280
And so, you know, over the years, when it comes around the holidays,

751
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,960
I love getting gifts for my team.

752
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:11,440
And for a long time, I'd always be guessing like what everyone wanted.

753
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:16,000
And you assume that something's cool or trending or whatever it may be.

754
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,440
And then you start to realize what you just said, people didn't really want that.

755
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,080
Yeah.

756
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,320
And then at one point we were like, okay, well then we won't give gifts.

757
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,720
We'll just, you know, thank people and whatever else it was.

758
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,120
But then we were like, no, but people like, people like it.

759
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:27,280
Yeah.

760
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,480
Everyone enjoys it.

761
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:29,280
And so, it's so funny.

762
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,120
We've started polling over the last few years.

763
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,960
Like what kind of gift would everyone like?

764
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,600
And the number one answer this year was infrared masks.

765
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,040
Like, so what are you calling out here?

766
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:37,760
Yeah.

767
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,120
That was the number one request.

768
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:39,920
Yeah, that's great.

769
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:40,480
The red light.

770
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,040
Yeah.

771
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,160
So that was the number one request.

772
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,120
And we're like, oh, easy.

773
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,800
Now we know what everyone wants.

774
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:49,760
So we're going to get that because it's easier rather than us guessing.

775
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,160
Yeah.

776
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:55,280
And I agree that I do think people inside of organizations today want mental health tools.

777
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:55,440
That's right.

778
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,440
They want meditation practices.

779
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:01,680
They want mindfulness opportunities and tools and apps and everything else.

780
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,000
I do believe there is a big demand for that.

781
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,400
And I think it's only growing.

782
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:06,960
Oh, yeah.

783
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,400
Because people are feeling that if you don't have that,

784
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,200
you can't have that conversation in the workplace.

785
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:13,600
That's right.

786
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:17,280
I think this is the part that I want companies and leaders to understand.

787
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:22,000
If you're not providing tools to support people with their mental health,

788
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:26,240
they don't have a vehicle to talk about it at work.

789
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:26,720
That's right.

790
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:29,760
If it's available to everyone and they see it come out in the newsletter

791
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:33,200
and the team's available and everyone knows about it, they can say,

792
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,800
oh, yeah, did you see we're using Calm now?

793
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,720
And, you know, I've been doing this one.

794
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:37,840
And which one have you been doing?

795
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:42,320
And now it allows for connection and conversation and community,

796
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:45,280
as opposed to without it, someone may just never talk about the fact

797
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,200
that they've been struggling to sleep for seven days.

798
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:47,920
A hundred percent.

799
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:48,320
Right?

800
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:48,800
A hundred percent.

801
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:52,080
And I find that, too, amongst the younger generation,

802
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:53,920
they just expect these things.

803
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:54,400
Yeah.

804
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,160
You know, and they're asking for them.

805
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,240
And they'll give up other things along the way.

806
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:58,640
Yeah.

807
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,800
And so, and they're very vocal around it.

808
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,760
And we've seen it now in all industries.

809
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,000
You know, we've seen it happen in banking,

810
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,080
where people feel like, hey, you're not listening.

811
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:13,200
And it takes a moment where they have to go to the press almost.

812
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:13,600
Right?

813
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,200
It shouldn't have to ever get there.

814
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:15,760
Yeah.

815
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:19,920
If they were listening to those kids and listening to your employees,

816
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,560
then you've got a continuous feedback loop.

817
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,120
Yeah.

818
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,960
More companies, the baseline will be,

819
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,960
you have to have these services going forward.

820
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:31,680
And, and I think over time, then that will open up a dialogue.

821
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,400
And I also think with CEOs today, I'll tell you,

822
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,000
because it starts so much at the top.

823
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,120
If you start to have some of these conversations and say,

824
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,160
here's how I think about it.

825
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,000
Here's how you're being vulnerable.

826
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,920
That too opens up a different conversation.

827
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,440
And then that can just kind of percolate within the company.

828
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:51,760
And, and then I think the whole thing starts to move faster.

829
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:52,800
Right?

830
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,920
And then we can start to get more into a conversation of like,

831
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,880
okay, now how do we get you the right care at the right time

832
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,480
when you need it, however you need it?

833
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:05,360
Because so much of the conversation we're having right now is pretty basic in my mind.

834
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,120
And we just need to get farther along in the conversation.

835
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:09,440
Yeah.

836
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:14,320
I think a lot of people will question listening to us going,

837
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:20,240
well, how does mindfulness or meditation actually help burnout?

838
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,920
Well, how does it help stress?

839
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:22,800
So that's one thing.

840
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,320
And I mean, there's tons of science on that,

841
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:27,280
but I think there's still, so I want, I want you to answer that.

842
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:31,200
And the second thing is, well, how does this affect my productivity?

843
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:31,440
Right?

844
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:35,600
Like how does it actually get people to do the work that I need them to do?

845
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,000
Sure.

846
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,720
And isn't this just a distraction or slows them down?

847
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:44,640
Because I know a lot of organizations just feel like this sounds good in theory,

848
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:45,520
but how does it help?

849
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:49,600
So if we could talk about how mindfulness and meditation, specifically the programs

850
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:53,520
that exist on Calm, how do they make sense for stress and burnout?

851
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,920
Then how do they make sense for productivity and performance?

852
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:56,160
Yeah.

853
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,440
I mean, I think I have both of those.

854
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:00,640
I'll start with the second one first because it comes up a lot.

855
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:06,000
And what I often tell people is when, I'll just use Calm as an example,

856
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:10,080
more than half the people that use Calm today come to us for sleep.

857
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:13,760
And they're having moments where they just can't fall asleep.

858
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:17,520
Most of that comes, as we know, because they're sleeping next to their devices.

859
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,520
The devices are constantly beeping.

860
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,640
They don't shut them off.

861
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:26,000
I talk about like, it's hard, but you know, I keep my phone outside my bedroom.

862
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,520
Not everyone does that.

863
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,800
When I travel, I don't do that.

864
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:34,400
And sometimes it leads to, you know, not a good sleep.

865
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:38,560
And we know when you have a number of those days that start to compound,

866
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,200
it could lead to irritability.

867
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:45,440
It could lead to not being as productive the next day when you go to work,

868
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,680
because you're just tired, right?

869
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:51,920
You couple that at times with potentially bad eating habits

870
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:56,320
or some people drinking habits or other types of habits that aren't.

871
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:00,480
And that doesn't create, and it creates kind of like what I call negative behavior.

872
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:04,400
I had that when I was younger because I didn't understand some of these tools.

873
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:08,160
And I just wish I had some of these tools when I was younger,

874
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:11,680
because I didn't, I didn't do those things that created positive behavior change.

875
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:17,040
Um, when I was in banking, for example, I, and when I got stressed,

876
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,880
I turned to smoking and I was just a kid.

877
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,440
And I was like smoking in the stairwell of Solomon brothers.

878
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,760
I shouldn't have been smoking in the stairwell.

879
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:26,560
That's number one.

880
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:33,520
I talked about this with our employees saying, Hey, I didn't have apps like calm or tools

881
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,640
to help me in the moment.

882
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,080
I wish I did.

883
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:41,360
I probably would have turned to other things and understood that's positive behavior

884
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,200
that I could turn to not negative behavior.

885
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:47,120
And if I have enough of that, then it starts to kind of change the pendulum

886
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:49,840
because I then ended up on a very slippery slope.

887
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:52,560
You know, you're smoking, you start to drink a little bit more,

888
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,960
then I'm eating more at odd hours.

889
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:55,920
And then I try to go to sleep.

890
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:59,520
And you just know if you're trying to eat Chinese food at 1130,

891
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:03,280
and you want to go to bed at 12 or 1230, you're not going to sleep well.

892
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,840
Cause there's just a lot of stuff just sitting there, right?

893
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,120
Keeping you awake.

894
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:10,240
And so for me, it's been this continuous kind of learning.

895
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:14,960
And we talk about some of these things and, you know, I think in the workforce,

896
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,720
it's, it's a little, it's no different.

897
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,920
Cause then people got to shuttle the kids off to school in the morning

898
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:20,960
and you got to make breakfast.

899
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,000
You got to do all these things.

900
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:25,600
So you, you kind of need good sleep at night.

901
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:28,160
And it starts, I think a lot there.

902
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,640
And then during the day, we need breaks.

903
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:37,200
People think, uh, and it's in the book that you, that our brain has endless capacity.

904
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:38,800
It's just not true.

905
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,240
We don't have endless capacity.

906
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:45,040
You know, our brain, like everything else needs to recharge.

907
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:50,800
And if you can find ways to recharge, whether it's listening to you every day,

908
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:54,400
uh, congratulations on over 600 episodes.

909
00:41:54,400 --> 00:42:01,440
We were talking about 50 million streams as our chief purpose officer, which I am so grateful for,

910
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:07,360
because there are times where those seven minutes from me, where I listen to you,

911
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:11,760
whether it's in the car, driving my kids, uh, to school takes 10 minutes.

912
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:14,240
Uh, some days it takes 30 with traffic.

913
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:18,720
There, there are moments that I just cherish or when I'm driving back alone.

914
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:24,880
And it's, it just helps me then as I start to recenter myself to be more productive during the

915
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:30,480
day or during the day, I take a short break and I know how to recharge now, whether it's going

916
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,080
outside, walking or others.

917
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:38,720
And it makes me so much more productive because what I find is if I work in a manner and I find

918
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:45,840
myself falling below 50%, 25% of my battery, and I just keep trying to power through my work gets,

919
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,200
it's not very good.

920
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,600
It's embarrassingly bad.

921
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:53,920
I would say at times and no amount of AI is going to make it better.

922
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:54,400
Yeah.

923
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,520
You know, it's just not.

924
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:56,000
Yeah.

925
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:03,360
And so I then have to kind of take a step back and be like, okay, you're trending in

926
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:04,160
the wrong direction.

927
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:05,440
Take a beat.

928
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:10,320
And I talk about this at a company and with many other companies that are out there today.

929
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:13,040
And I know so many employees I talk to resonate around this.

930
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:13,520
Yeah.

931
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:13,760
Right.

932
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,680
Cause they just feel it's an endless hamster wheel.

933
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:16,240
For sure.

934
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:16,560
Right.

935
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:16,880
Sure.

936
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:17,120
Yeah.

937
00:43:17,120 --> 00:43:23,040
I was, as you were speaking, I was thinking about how if you have a still mind, you actually

938
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:31,040
make quicker, better decisions. And if you have a stressed mind, you actually make slower,

939
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:32,480
worse decisions.

940
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:33,200
Yeah.

941
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:37,920
And we think, oh, well, if I take time out to be still, I'll lose time. But actually,

942
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:40,240
if you take time out to be still, you'll gain time.

943
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:40,640
Yeah.

944
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:46,480
Because you'll make better decisions. They'll be more long-term. They won't be rushed and haphazard.

945
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:51,600
And they'll actually be, you'll be a better communicator. I know for a fact that if I'm stressed,

946
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:53,680
I don't communicate as clearly. Yeah.

947
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:59,200
I can, I can be a bit more like rushed and, you know, kind of like, let's hurry this up and short.

948
00:43:59,200 --> 00:43:59,920
Short with people.

949
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:06,240
Yeah. Whereas if I'm rested and I'm still, then actually I'm able to formulate ideas.

950
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:10,560
I can be more tolerant. I can be more patient, which are all the skills you need. And so

951
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:17,200
taking out seven minutes a day doesn't make you slower. It actually makes you faster and better.

952
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:21,440
And, and something I pulled from your book, these, these stats were really fascinating for me to

953
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:28,080
read. So 61% of people feel expected to just get over stress.

954
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:28,480
Yeah.

955
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:29,920
Yeah.

956
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:37,520
That's unbelievable that 61% of people feel like they're expected to just get over stress.

957
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:37,840
Yeah.

958
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:46,240
It's just, why is that when I was younger and I didn't understand this, uh, when I was 14 years

959
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:50,160
old and I think it was much younger. I wrote about it in the book that it was 14. I actually think it

960
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:56,240
happened when I was younger. I just didn't, I just don't recollect those times when I got really

961
00:44:56,240 --> 00:45:01,840
stressed or nervous. And most of the time they're around like tests or speaking stuff or in front of

962
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:08,080
the class, I just started to get a tightness in my chest. I would, I would get shortness of breath

963
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:12,880
at times. I would sweat in my hands and I didn't really understand what was happening. And I talked

964
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:19,040
to my mom, you know, and like a very traditional Korean mother, she'd be like, just power through it.

965
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:22,640
And I'm like, okay, I'm just going to power through it. Right. But she didn't know either

966
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:26,880
what was happening. And I don't blame her around that. She just didn't understand in the moment.

967
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:32,480
You know, the reality is when you think about your mental health, it's not about just do,

968
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:37,200
you know, and it's not about powering through the moment. It's for me, it's about powering up,

969
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,360
you know, and it's, and that's where the battery analogy keeps coming back in.

970
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:46,480
Yeah. And, and I didn't understand some of that. And then you cup, and then I didn't have the

971
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:51,200
vocabulary. It wasn't really until I started getting into healthcare that I started to understand,

972
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:56,560
oh, wow, this is what you were going through. You've been able to kind of manage it and through

973
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:01,280
some unhealthy behaviors at times. And now you are doing it through healthy behaviors,

974
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:07,040
but the vocabulary has changed. Right. And you have a better command of that vocabulary. So you

975
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:09,680
know how to talk about it now where I didn't know how to talk about it then.

976
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:16,000
Yeah. And so I do think so much of the, the population today is about powering through it.

977
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:22,160
And I do think a lot of the population, and I would say more in countries like Korea or Asia,

978
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:27,360
even though mental health is the most approachable it's ever been, like in the States,

979
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:34,560
it's not really approachable there, you know, and, and that does make me sad at times when I go back

980
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:38,480
home, my parents moved back to Korea, they live there. I want to talk about these things with them.

981
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:43,840
And it's just not, it's not easy for them to talk about. Right. I don't know how it was for you.

982
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:45,920
Yeah, I know. Did you talk about this when you were a kid with you?

983
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:49,280
It's so interesting what you were saying about your experiences of stress growing up,

984
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:53,760
mine were the same and they didn't know what it was either. So I would, it's the same things,

985
00:46:53,760 --> 00:47:00,480
exams, anything high performance related. I'd feel like my chest got tighter. My heart felt like it

986
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:06,320
wasn't being the same. I'd get, you know, sweaty palms. And I remember going to the doctors and

987
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:12,240
they'd wire me up with these monitors, like old school monitors, big things. I'd have to wear it for

988
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:17,600
24 hours. And I'd go back and they'd be like, oh, he's fine. And I'd be like, but mom, I'm not fine.

989
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:22,240
Like there's something I'm feeling and there was no word for it. And so I can very much relate.

990
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:25,680
And again, my mom didn't know what it was either. And she was trying her best to help,

991
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:31,200
but we couldn't figure it out. And so I got on with it and I always have. And then I was thankful

992
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:37,120
enough to learn mindfulness and meditation many years later that have been my core practices.

993
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:41,920
And now it's not that I don't get nervous before I'm going on stage or a podcast.

994
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:47,520
I still do, but I know what to do. And so I have my breath work. I know what I have to lock into.

995
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:53,120
It's not that I don't experience those emotions anymore, but I agree even in a South Asian family,

996
00:47:53,120 --> 00:48:00,480
like I don't think that vulnerability was normal from parents. It wasn't common for uncles and aunts

997
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:05,520
to be that way. And so it created a culture of always putting your best foot forward,

998
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:09,120
always somewhat being performative.

999
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:09,680
That's right.

1000
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:14,240
And I think I never subscribed to that. So I started very early on rebelling and just

1001
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:14,800
Good for you.

1002
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:15,760
Being myself.

1003
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:18,240
I wish I had done that.

1004
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:22,960
Yeah. And I was just, I'm just, I started breaking the rules early on that and I'm grateful that I

1005
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:29,120
did. But now I realize it wasn't that I was breaking the rules. I was just expressing my

1006
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:36,160
discomfort with having to put up a face or a mask on when everything wasn't okay.

1007
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:36,880
Yeah.

1008
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:43,280
And, and I think that's hard for people to do today, where I read another stat that said 33%

1009
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:47,520
of people feel too overwhelmed by daily stress to think ahead.

1010
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:48,080
Yeah.

1011
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:53,040
Like when you think about that, it's like, gosh, like, you know, that's what people are under.

1012
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:53,520
Mm-hmm.

1013
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:54,400
What are some of the-

1014
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:55,520
I mean, you forget that, right?

1015
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:56,240
You forget that.

1016
00:48:56,240 --> 00:49:02,320
You just forget it. I mean, you think about those numbers, that's whether it's two thirds or one third

1017
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:08,320
of all people feeling this way. And you start to realize, well, that's heavy, you know? And

1018
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:12,320
if you were in a room and three out of 10 or six out of 10 are feeling a certain way,

1019
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:17,120
you start to realize there's more. This is why with corporations, I think it's so important

1020
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:18,800
that they can take leadership positions.

1021
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:19,840
Mm-hmm.

1022
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:22,640
Again, I always go back to the top on some of these things, because

1023
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:29,120
if we're not comfortable being vulnerable, and if we're not comfortable making sure that our

1024
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:34,400
HR teams have the tools to talk about this with employees, that we don't support some of these

1025
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:40,320
initiatives, we're kind of in a place where we're saying, oh, we don't believe some of those stats,

1026
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:41,600
but the stats are there and growing.

1027
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:42,240
Mm-hmm.

1028
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:47,040
Right? And, and yes, there's, you know, there's life things that are happening,

1029
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:49,520
but technology is moving so fast on the other side.

1030
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:50,000
Mm-hmm.

1031
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:54,560
Right? I mean, we are definitely in an era right now where kids have grown up with their

1032
00:49:54,560 --> 00:50:00,240
smartphones. They act differently than, you know, when I grew up or when you grew up. It's just

1033
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:04,320
different. We, and they grew up with this technology. They're very comfortable with it,

1034
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:09,280
the speed of it, which is coming. And so, and then there's the weight of what's happening just

1035
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:15,360
in life around them. And so some of these things, even at the company level, which are interesting,

1036
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:19,440
and you don't do this is like, and I found this a little bit with myself. I'll just tell you on a

1037
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:25,600
personal front, we're taught to play it very safe. And I think that's an important thing,

1038
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:30,640
too. I'll tell you a lot of people miss is that, you know, you don't want to say the wrong thing.

1039
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:34,080
So you're not going to talk about your own vulnerability because that's not playing it

1040
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:38,960
down the fairway. You kind of want to be boring. I'll be frank with you for a lot of leaders,

1041
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:43,680
not all leaders, which we know there's a couple of them that are quite, but for most leaders,

1042
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:48,880
when you go out there, they're media trained to be right down the fairway.

1043
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:55,600
And what I love when I listen and watch your podcast, it's so authentic. It's so real.

1044
00:50:56,160 --> 00:51:02,800
It's so safe for all the people that listen. And then, and it just shows right with how many people

1045
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:07,440
are tuning in every day. Right. And listening to you and doing what I did. It's like, I'll listen

1046
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:10,640
to somebody and then I'll go back to that. I'll be like, Oh, I remembered that I'm going to go back

1047
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:16,720
to that. And it's just because we just play it safe in a lot of places today. And you don't want

1048
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:21,280
to say the wrong thing. Yeah. And I think it's okay. You know, like even if I was here with you

1049
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:27,040
today and maybe something, and I didn't say the right thing today, I'm in a space where I feel so

1050
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:30,960
safe with you right now. I just want to be myself and not everything's going to be perfect.

1051
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:35,600
Absolutely. Right. And, and that's kind of part of life. And I've started to accept that.

1052
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:41,360
And I've become much more vulnerable with my own employees to be like, Hey, this is okay.

1053
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:47,200
And because of that, in the last couple of years, we're stronger, we're stronger as a company.

1054
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:52,160
We just had a board meeting and they're like, wow, this is great. Everyone's like, yes,

1055
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:56,960
we're doing much better. But I think because we're developing and, and really building on the right

1056
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:01,760
culture, we're asking the right questions or, and we want to lead by example. Yeah. Right.

1057
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:07,200
What was something you shared with them that you feel was challenging, uncomfortable that,

1058
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:12,160
that led to that breakthrough? Yeah. I, um, in the last one that you were at,

1059
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:19,360
I did talk about my smoking as a kid. I talked about me being overweight as a child, dealing with

1060
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:27,840
that, that insecurity. Um, I've always had a struggle with food. I love French fries. I'm just gonna,

1061
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:34,960
yeah, I guess I'm telling you, I love ice cream. And I think sometimes, and I have a really,

1062
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:42,080
no matter what I try to do diet wise, I, if you put some fries in front of me, I'm gonna eat them.

1063
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:48,560
Uh, if I, if you put some ice cream in front of me and someone, my kids are having, I'm gonna eat

1064
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:52,640
some of that too. And my kids are like, dad, I thought you're like full. I was like, I was.

1065
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:58,720
All right. So I struggle with that. I know when I'm a little bit stressed, I'm a little bit of a binge

1066
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:04,960
eater as well. I try to obviously develop a lot of healthy habits also around how to be healthier.

1067
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:10,960
And so I do, I do exercise a lot more, but some of those things are hard just to get rid of,

1068
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:15,520
you know, it's, it's more like you're going to have to live with it and it's how you live with it.

1069
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:19,040
That's like that comment about stress. You're never going to have a stress-free workplace,

1070
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:22,880
but you got to figure out how you just have more healthy stress,

1071
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:27,280
right. How you stress rather than distress. Yeah. What's, what's the most common thing

1072
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:31,760
you hear from leaders that they're struggling with in their organizations when it comes to

1073
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:38,240
stress and teams, mental health. I, I think a lot of leaders today struggle with,

1074
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:43,520
as I spoke to you about vulnerability and how you gave the story about vulnerability,

1075
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:47,120
that story plays over, over and over again. Wow.

1076
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:52,240
You know, leaders struggle with how to be vulnerable. And I think it's, I think it's

1077
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:56,320
generational on a personal, I think the new leaders that are going to rise,

1078
00:53:56,320 --> 00:54:01,600
the ones in their twenties are going to have no problem. All right. Because when you look at social

1079
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:06,080
media today and a lot of the younger generation, they talk about their mental stress and they talk

1080
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:12,800
about their mental health and they're very open about it. Now, again, they may overuse it or, you know,

1081
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:18,240
but at least they're having a conversation around it. I think, you know, with other leaders today,

1082
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:22,640
when I talk to them, they're just like, Hey, is it a sign of weakness? Like you brought up

1083
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:27,440
in, is it going to be used against me? Yeah. Is someone going to write about it and say,

1084
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:34,560
I'm too weak. Is the board going to think I'm weak as a leader? And I think that is the,

1085
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:40,480
that's ultimately also a fail of corporate stewardship because they have to also look after

1086
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:45,280
your mental health, you know? And so when I'm, you know, I'm fortunate to be on the board of calm

1087
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:53,200
today, but if I wasn't CEO, I would be asking that CEO, Hey, how are you doing? How are you holding

1088
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:58,400
up? Let's not talk about the numbers today. You know, I find it really effective when I meet with

1089
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:04,400
CEOs and they ask for some coaching. We don't talk about any numbers. We don't talk about the metrics.

1090
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:11,680
We just talk about life and we'll eventually go to that later. But I think when we start with more

1091
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:16,880
of a trusting place where we can understand what's happening around you, then I can be much more

1092
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:22,560
thoughtful in the type of advice I give. But this also means I have to create the space and the time

1093
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:27,280
to do it. So not everyone has that. Right. And that's where I think it's just really important to

1094
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:32,000
be really intentional. Yeah. Right. Be really purposeful in these conversations. Yeah. I think one of the

1095
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:38,000
reasons why we struggle to recharge is because when your phone's running out of battery,

1096
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:42,960
there's only one, well, we're also bad at this. There's only meant to be one type of charger.

1097
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:49,600
Now I've seen people charge their phone with their Mac charger, destroying your phone. Right. You'd see

1098
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:55,440
it being charged with the iPad charger. Like, but the point is there's one charger. Yeah. And I think

1099
00:55:55,440 --> 00:56:06,080
when it comes to life, sleep is a charger. Meditation and mindfulness. 100%. Food is a charger. Working

1100
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:12,560
out is a charger. And people you love being around good relationships are a charger. And if everyone,

1101
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:19,440
while you're listening to this, if you could figure out the most common times you feel at 1%, 5%,

1102
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:25,520
10%, 20%, and figure out what's the charge you need for that. Well said. Right. Like, that's what

1103
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:30,880
I think we need to do. Like, I'll give an example. I went to an event the other day and I had to fly

1104
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:36,720
out of town and come back into town. I got back at like 4 a.m. And I worked out the next day and I felt

1105
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:43,680
so weak because I hadn't slept well. Of course. And I had eaten well. And so at that point, I'm glad I still

1106
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:48,560
worked out because I needed it. But I told my trainer I had to get a bit of an easier workout because I

1107
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:55,360
didn't want to push myself when I felt weak. But it's like, it takes little adjustments of figuring

1108
00:56:55,360 --> 00:57:00,240
out what charge you need right now. Like now, I've had a busy week, had a busy weekend. This weekend,

1109
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:06,240
I know recharge means I need no social plans. Like, that's what's going to recharge me. And so I wish

1110
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:10,160
everyone could just write down while you're listening to this and while you're reading David's book,

1111
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:15,520
Recharge, you write down what are those most common experiences you feel when you feel drained,

1112
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:20,720
when you feel overwhelmed, when you feel burnt out and what is your charger so that you don't have

1113
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:23,520
to think about it in the moment. Because when you're trying to figure it out in the moment,

1114
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:29,280
that's when you get more overwhelmed. Like I know before I go on stage, I always practice breath work.

1115
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:34,640
If I've had a couple of late nights, I know sleep is the only charge that's going to solve it.

1116
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:39,360
Yeah. Speaking of that, because you've talked about certain rituals. Are there

1117
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:44,240
certain things that you do every day, like religion every day that you just do?

1118
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:50,160
Yeah, I kind of do what I call like, what I feel is like a good 80-20. So like, I know five days

1119
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:57,360
out of the seven days a week, I'm working out. Five days out of seven, I'm meditating before 9am.

1120
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:03,120
And then the other two will be meditating after 9am. And I like that balance that I have.

1121
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:06,320
Gratitude is something I'm practicing every single day.

1122
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:11,840
Yeah, it's such an important one. I think we do something with my team that I love. Every

1123
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:17,440
Friday, we'll do a weekly win. And everyone's encouraged to share what they believe is their

1124
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:23,520
win. And sometimes what's amazing about this activity is you feel it will always be like,

1125
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:29,920
oh, we had so-and-so on the podcast, or we won so-and-so award or, and it isn't. It's actually

1126
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:35,680
these little things that people are doing behind the scenes that are not like these grand wins

1127
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:40,720
externally. And they believe that that's been their success. And I think it's a really great

1128
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:45,200
way to actually get to know each other because you get to see what people value as success.

1129
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:45,920
Yeah, 100%.

1130
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:50,800
And you get to understand what people see as value in the work they do. Whereas we just assume that,

1131
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:54,560
of course, if there's a big quarter, then everyone should be excited. And it's like,

1132
00:58:54,560 --> 00:58:55,440
well, maybe not.

1133
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:55,840
Right.

1134
00:58:55,840 --> 00:59:01,360
Because that's not what they equate as their personal success and contribution. And so

1135
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:04,640
doing the weekly wins on Friday is one of my favorite things to do with my team.

1136
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:05,200
I love that.

1137
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:06,800
It takes like 30 minutes to do.

1138
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:07,360
Yeah.

1139
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:10,960
And everyone just goes around my core team and just shares what was their weekly win.

1140
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:11,120
Yeah.

1141
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:11,600
It's huge.

1142
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:16,320
I love that. I sometimes start my beginning of the week staff meetings with like, how was your

1143
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:21,680
weekend? Just tell us something that happened personal. You know, I also find sometimes we get into

1144
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:25,840
all the details without getting to know one another. Yeah. You know, and I find a lot,

1145
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:31,280
a lot of times teams don't work well. They can work better together when they're a little bit

1146
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:35,120
more personal with one another. And it may, it doesn't have to be deep. It could just be like,

1147
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:39,600
hey, what did you do? Some people will say, I went on a hike. I, you know, went to my kid's game

1148
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:44,960
or, you know, I went, I traveled somewhere or binge watched a show and we're all like, what show?

1149
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:48,560
What's your favorite show or something? And we just get to learn something a little bit more

1150
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:54,960
personal about the individual. And then it's less about, oh, did you hand in that PRD or something?

1151
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:57,200
Right. It's just, it's more personal. Yeah.

1152
00:59:57,200 --> 01:00:02,800
And I think, and by you just doing your wins every week, you know, how I just, I love that.

1153
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:08,000
Yeah. I think about it as very simple. I think about it like this, like you're going to spend

1154
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,920
a third of your life at work. Yeah.

1155
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:12,880
Learn to get along with your colleagues. Yeah.

1156
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:18,160
Learn to build relationships with the people you spend nine hours a day with.

1157
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:22,960
You're going to spend a third of your life with these people. You should actually really get

1158
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:27,520
to know them. You should be able to laugh with them. It would be wonderful if you could open your

1159
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:32,960
heart with them. When we kind of go, well, work's this thing over here and I save all of that for

1160
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:39,360
home. You're basically saying that 30% of your life, you'll never experience joy. You'll never

1161
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:44,080
experience connection. And I don't think that's the world we want anymore. I think we need a world

1162
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:48,240
where work can be meaningful and thoughtful and purposeful. And again, going back to what you

1163
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:51,200
said, it's not that it will ever be stress free. That's right.

1164
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:55,920
It's not that it's ever going to be perfect or this utopia or this beautiful place where

1165
01:00:55,920 --> 01:01:01,280
everything's amazing. But I think one of the things we don't realize is that a lack of productivity

1166
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:03,360
stems from a lack of trust. Yeah.

1167
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:08,960
When you have trust and you have interpersonal connection, things move faster. People are not

1168
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:14,720
gatekeeping. No one's trying to be a bottleneck. No one's looking out for how they can be top dog.

1169
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:17,360
There's this feeling of we're all going to win together. And I think

1170
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:24,400
if leaders can start to figure out what that culture is, then people will achieve so much more

1171
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:29,840
and they'll be happier. I think, you know, one of my, I would hate to be at the top of a hill with the

1172
01:01:29,840 --> 01:01:34,720
team and three people like gave up along the way. Two people told me they never want to come back.

1173
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:35,440
That's right.

1174
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:40,400
It's in it. I was, I was going to ask you, you've had so much business success before Calm, you're

1175
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:46,400
now at Calm. Like walk us through how your views have changed of recharging and recharging your team.

1176
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:50,160
It's, it's, it's actually really interesting. I used to be one of the youngest execs in the room,

1177
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:55,840
and now I'm the oldest person in the room. I think when I was younger,

1178
01:01:55,840 --> 01:02:03,120
I felt that I had to be in every decision process. And that's a little bit of like,

1179
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:08,320
oh, I'm productive because I got my hands in everything. And it was probably the opposite.

1180
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:13,280
I was probably causing more stress and less productivity on a person. And I realized that

1181
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:20,160
later that it's, it's not the number of meetings or decisions you're making. It's not the quantity.

1182
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:24,240
It's the quality of those decisions. And I keep going back always the quality of decision making.

1183
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:26,800
What is a quality decision? Let's, let's define that.

1184
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:27,920
Yeah, that's great. Yeah.

1185
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:33,360
So like it's, it's things that you feel that where you sit could move the, for me,

1186
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:37,840
could move the business forward in the most meaningful manner. So sometimes it could be

1187
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:42,720
helping teams unlock a product decision. Sometimes it could be helping teams with

1188
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:48,560
things that partnerships that may move it forward. Other times it may mean things around culture or HR,

1189
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:53,040
but it's really being intentional in terms of the types of decisions you're making and where

1190
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:58,480
you're spending your time. It's not being in every decision with everybody because ultimately

1191
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:05,360
they have to make decisions too. One thing we've been doing now that I feel that has really brought

1192
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:11,280
the company closer together is, uh, we did this retreat where it wasn't just a leadership team.

1193
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:16,320
We brought many different people together. And I said, you guys come up with the company strategy.

1194
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:22,960
And they were like, and this woman, uh, they were like, what? And I'm like, they're like, don't you

1195
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:29,440
have it? My younger self would have been like, here it is. I was like, no, you do it. And I'll tell

1196
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:36,880
you, it was so much better than what I was thinking. And it just reminded me again, you hire all these

1197
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:42,800
smart people. You take all these time vetting them, doing reference checks, let them do their job.

1198
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:49,040
Give them a chance. If it was a sports analogy to shoot the ball, give them a chance to play.

1199
01:03:49,040 --> 01:03:53,920
You know, don't feel like you're keeping them on the bench the whole time and you have to do

1200
01:03:53,920 --> 01:04:00,960
everything and give them a shot. And I, I do that a lot more now. I'm much more intentional with it.

1201
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:06,320
Now. It was great. We rolled it out to the company at that offsite you were at. People came away and said

1202
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:11,680
it was the most inspiring offsite. And they were like, that was great. I said, I didn't do it.

1203
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:17,920
They did it. It came from the team. And I think it felt so much more meaningful to them because it

1204
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:23,280
came from them and it was so much more spot on. And we, and, and really what it was around was

1205
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:27,920
we've talked about trying to make the world healthier and happier. We've tried, we've talked

1206
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:31,680
about as a company, trying to be with you every step of the way in your mental health journey.

1207
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:36,080
And this was really around how to become, how do we become the most impactful

1208
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:42,160
consumer mental health company in the world? And when I sat back and said,

1209
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:48,240
that's what we want to become. And the team had kind of been the one synthesizing it.

1210
01:04:49,120 --> 01:04:53,760
Then everyone started mobilizing against it on their own. And I, and I, and they had thought

1211
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:58,640
about things that I had never even thought about because I'm just too far sometimes away from the

1212
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:06,640
details. And then now I've, I've seen us accelerate and I know that motion and muscle can be repeated.

1213
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:10,000
Right. And you can bring it to other companies, regardless of size.

1214
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:14,320
And I think sometimes as companies get larger and I've had the fortune of starting my own company

1215
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:19,520
where it's like three of us, and then it grows to 30, whatever, 300 and then to thousands.

1216
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:24,640
And then I've had the fortune of joining companies later where it's thousands and it becomes hundreds of

1217
01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:31,760
thousands. Ultimately that culture is your bedrock, you know, whether or not how many people you stack

1218
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:36,800
on top of it, what you start to set as your foundation will percolate amongst the entire company.

1219
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:42,880
And if you don't do that the right way, and if you're not thought, then you may not get the results

1220
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:47,440
that you're happy with. Right. And you may create more stressful environments that you just unintentionally

1221
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:53,040
didn't think about. And that's where I really appreciate about when leaders come around,

1222
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:57,040
they talk about being more thoughtful in their decision-making process, being more vulnerable,

1223
01:05:57,040 --> 01:06:02,720
being more open, really thinking about employees' mental health, but then not just talking about it,

1224
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:04,960
but then really acting upon it. Totally.

1225
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:11,120
And if you can do that a little bit year after year, right, you can really create a special culture.

1226
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:15,920
And I think they'll do special things. Absolutely. David, it's been such a joy talking to you

1227
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:21,760
today. I really enjoyed our dialogue around recharging and, you know, I'm so grateful for

1228
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:29,920
the work you're doing at Calm because I remember being an analyst at Accenture and I was tasked...

1229
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:33,360
I'm sure you were really good. I was okay. I was tasked with

1230
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:39,200
teaching meditation in my spare time and mindfulness in my spare time at the company. And I would travel

1231
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:45,280
around and I would do lunchtime sessions and after work sessions and I couldn't scale myself.

1232
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:51,360
But now thanks to Calm, not only am I able to scale myself to more people, but we're able to

1233
01:06:51,360 --> 01:06:57,280
introduce people to so many amazing hosts and narrators that we have on Calm. And I think inside

1234
01:06:57,280 --> 01:07:02,640
an organization, you no longer need someone running around the organization physically,

1235
01:07:03,200 --> 01:07:07,040
trying to serve lots of people. You actually have the ability for everyone to tune in.

1236
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:13,360
And we end every On Purpose episode with a final five. These questions have to be answered in one

1237
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:19,760
word to one sentence maximum. So David Koh, these are your final five. The first question is,

1238
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:24,000
what is the best recharge advice you've ever heard in your life?

1239
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:33,440
To be more present. I recognize at times that I've been there, but not really. And so you are,

1240
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:38,560
you do so good at this where you're just so present, whether it's one person or hundreds or thousands,

1241
01:07:38,560 --> 01:07:43,600
I've seen it. I've been in your auditoriums where you've traveled and everyone feels your presence.

1242
01:07:44,240 --> 01:07:44,960
And so presence.

1243
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:50,400
I like that answer. Not the part about me, you're very kind, but the, uh, because I don't think we

1244
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:55,440
realize how draining it is when you're not present. And you gave that great analogy earlier, when you

1245
01:07:55,440 --> 01:08:01,760
have lots of tabs and apps open, that's when we drain our battery. And so so many of us are draining our

1246
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:05,520
battery by thinking, oh, I'm here right now with David, but actually if my mind's over there,

1247
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:09,600
I'll get more done. And you're actually depleting your battery. So it's a great answer.

1248
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:15,360
Uh, second question. What is the worst advice you've ever heard about recharging yourself?

1249
01:08:17,280 --> 01:08:22,480
Sorry, mom. Cause she's going to be listening and watching. Uh, and my mom, I love my mom. So

1250
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:26,640
I'm going to start by that. And she's giving me lots of great advice, but this probably was the

1251
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:32,400
worst advice she gave me as a child, which was to power through. And it's not about powering through.

1252
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:38,160
It's really about powering up and she didn't know, you know, but you know, mom, I think it was not

1253
01:08:38,160 --> 01:08:42,800
about powering through. Question number three, what's your three favorite ways to power up?

1254
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:50,400
So I have rituals like you and my rituals in the morning. Uh, when I wake up, I don't look at my

1255
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:58,080
phone right away. I actually go downstairs. I start the coffee. I open the window and, uh, I walk

1256
01:08:58,080 --> 01:09:03,440
outside and I take three breaths. And it's been something I've been very intentional about doing.

1257
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:07,520
If I'm traveling, I try to open the window, you know, wherever it may be, if you're an apartment or

1258
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:16,080
something, that process starts to center me. The second I do is I do a lot of walking meetings.

1259
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:21,600
And so I'm a big fan of like trying to break things up that helped me reach her. So people

1260
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:27,440
give me energy. I would say going outside, breathing people give me energy. And then lastly,

1261
01:09:27,440 --> 01:09:33,280
I think similar to yourself, I love to exercise as well. And I've become a lot better at keeping a

1262
01:09:33,280 --> 01:09:37,760
steady schedule around it. And even someone said this to me the other day, they said, do something

1263
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:43,520
every day. Right. And, and I'm like, great. I'm gonna do something every day. And I'm gonna be

1264
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:48,640
really intentional about it and just keep at it. Uh, some days I'll go to the gym. Sometimes I'll do

1265
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:53,680
something at home. It'd be really quick. Um, but exercise as well. I love that. Question number four,

1266
01:09:53,680 --> 01:10:00,400
what are your three favorite ways to power down? I turn everything off, meaning the following.

1267
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:05,600
So it won't be just putting my phone and turning it over. Cause I don't think sometimes that's enough.

1268
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:12,080
I'll just be like, you know what? I'm kind of done. I wanted to ask you earlier, because I'm curious

1269
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:18,880
if you had a day and you didn't use your phone, social media, what does that day look like for you?

1270
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:25,040
Those are the best days. It doesn't happen very often. I've definitely tried really hard. One

1271
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:28,720
thing I've really focused on is when me and my wife are together in the evening for dinner. And

1272
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:33,280
then if we are watching a show or something is not bringing the phone to those two things,

1273
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:37,360
because I found myself a lot of the time, like finishing off last emails, messaging while we're

1274
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:42,000
having dinner. And then when you're watching a show, you're distracted. And then you watch your

1275
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:47,440
partner get distracted. And then you're like mad at them for getting distracted. But then when they

1276
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:50,480
put their phone down, you've got yours up and they're mad at you for getting distracted. And

1277
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:55,120
I was like, what are we doing here? And I was starting to notice just my attention span just

1278
01:10:55,760 --> 01:11:02,320
dropping. I've noticed that a lot in the last 12 months, more than any time before. And I've

1279
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:07,200
realized so much of it is because of just the speed of consumption. So now it's not even that we're

1280
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:13,680
consuming a lot. We're consuming a lot at a really fast rate. And so you're just making it easier for

1281
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:20,800
your mind to get two seconds of everything. And so for me, I try and make my weekends very phone

1282
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:26,960
free because weekdays I am on my phone. I've also found that even when I'm with my team, if I can

1283
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:31,920
have my laptop in the room, but my laptop's not connected to messaging apps, and then my phone's

1284
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:36,960
not in the room, I actually find I'm better with my team. So I can still do email. I can still do work

1285
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:42,400
on my laptop, but it's not wired up to WhatsApp. It's not wired up to text message. I don't need

1286
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:47,520
it. And so I've been trying to leave my phone actually out of my hand when I'm not traveling.

1287
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:53,040
If I'm going out for work or driving, of course I need my phone. But if I'm in the office, I don't

1288
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:58,960
need my phone on me in meetings or in between meetings actually. And all of this is stuff I'm

1289
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:03,600
still working on too, because I find myself go through ups and downs with it. There are times when

1290
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:08,000
I'm brilliant at it. I also follow you. I don't keep my phone in my bedroom. Don't look at it

1291
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:12,880
first thing in the morning. But I also have days where I break that completely when I'm traveling.

1292
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:18,640
And so I don't want to make anyone feel like I've got it down or perfect because I haven't.

1293
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:22,960
And I think it's almost like peaks and troughs. There's always a good day and a bad week and

1294
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:25,600
a good week and a bad day. Yeah. Yeah. That's great. That's brilliant.

1295
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:26,880
I love that. Just being honest. Yeah.

1296
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:32,720
Fifth and final question to David Coe. If you could create one law that everyone in the world had to

1297
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:38,720
follow, what would it be? Kids have to go to gym five days and they know there's physical exercise.

1298
01:12:38,720 --> 01:12:44,400
And it's just kind of like, it's just understood. Why can't we take some of that time for children

1299
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:49,200
to also better understand their own mental health and to teach them about their mental health?

1300
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:53,280
Because we know so much of this starts early, just like it started with myself at 14.

1301
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:59,360
If I had that vocabulary at 14, I probably would have developed better kind of healthy behaviors at 14

1302
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:04,960
and did that as I turned into a young adult. So I would love to take a little bit of time.

1303
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:09,120
It doesn't have to be all the time. It could be carve outs, maybe once, twice, three times a week,

1304
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:14,960
where we educate our children and check up on them on their mental health or their battery and ask

1305
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:19,200
them the question. I love that. What a great law. That would have a big impact on the world.

1306
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:24,880
The book is called Recharge. We've got interviews with everyone from Randall Park to Macklemore.

1307
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:30,400
It's a brilliant book. So fascinating. I love the format. I love the format. The format's

1308
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:36,720
fantastic. Like you sat down with experts, with rappers, with rebels, innovators, thought leaders,

1309
01:13:36,720 --> 01:13:41,040
and you put together this beautiful book called Recharge. David, I'm so grateful that you put it

1310
01:13:41,040 --> 01:13:44,880
together. I'm so grateful we connected. Yeah. And thank you for taking the time,

1311
01:13:44,880 --> 01:13:50,720
having me here. Thank you for talking about the book. It's something I'm so proud of. I hope

1312
01:13:50,720 --> 01:13:55,200
people, people get some, you know, really get something out of it. We talked to a lot of

1313
01:13:55,200 --> 01:14:00,640
different folks, like you said, uh, like Randall, who's, you know, you know as well, and many other

1314
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:07,760
folks there, uh, Delilah, and they just talked about so many amazing things. And I, um, I was really

1315
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:12,960
touched by talking to each and every one of them. I was honored to hear their stories and it just made

1316
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:17,360
me a better person. It also has helped me in my mental health journey, and I hope it helps some other

1317
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:20,960
people as well. David, thank you so much. Is there anything I didn't ask you that you really

1318
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:25,040
want to touch on something that's on your heart or mind that's calling for you to share? I'd love

1319
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:31,200
for you to share it. You never asked me how my battery is. How's your battery? I would tell you

1320
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:35,760
my battery is at a hundred, over a hundred percent, because I got to spend time with you.

1321
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:42,800
Oh, you're too kind. No, no. And I'll tell you, conversations like this just recharge and energize me.

1322
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:47,840
I love the fact that we got to sit. I love the fact that I got to know you personally and

1323
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:53,520
professionally. I'm so grateful for our friendship, your mentorship, your words of wisdom. I know how

1324
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:59,600
many millions of people you affect every day. I mean, over 50 million people, the entire employee

1325
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:07,200
base of calm, uh, really just, uh, I can't tell you the impact you've made both, uh, on us on a

1326
01:15:07,200 --> 01:15:10,640
personal and professional front. So thank you. I want to ask you, how's your battery?

1327
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:14,800
Do you know what? And I'm not just saying this because you're here and I, and I really do mean

1328
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:20,880
it. You've recharged my battery too. Like this conversation is, I'd say before you came in today,

1329
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:23,280
I was probably at like a 60. Yeah.

1330
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:27,440
Yeah. I've had a lot of social events in the past couple of weeks. Just we had Diwali,

1331
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:33,040
which is our beautiful festival every year. We had, there was just so much going on and all good

1332
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:35,040
stuff, all stuff I wanted to go to. Yeah.

1333
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:41,360
Yeah. But I'm very disciplined about my sleep all year round. And at this time of year, I kind of let

1334
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:46,560
go a little bit because there are so many wonderful events that I get invited to. And so I've been

1335
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:53,280
feeling a bit, and as soon as you came in, you took me from a 60 to a 95 easily. And honestly,

1336
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:58,560
it's this conversation because it felt so real, so authentic, so genuine. I felt like, again, you were

1337
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:02,720
really present. And I think that's what we don't realize when you're present with someone, you're charging

1338
01:16:02,720 --> 01:16:10,080
them up while you're being charged. And that's such a superpower that often we think, oh, if I'm

1339
01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:15,360
charging someone else off, I'm losing energy. But that's not true. If you're charging someone else

1340
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:21,040
up by being present, you're getting charged up and so are they. And we've both felt that today.

1341
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:28,240
And I genuinely felt that today. And honestly, Calm has just been such a brilliant partner. It's the

1342
01:16:28,240 --> 01:16:33,040
team I love working with every day, whether it's the content team, the team that we work with in

1343
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:39,200
the studio, the team that I get to see once a year, the leadership. Everyone walks the talk there.

1344
01:16:39,200 --> 01:16:44,960
And it's so impressive to me. Thank you. Because I felt it from the moment I started doing Zooms and

1345
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:49,680
meetings with everyone at Calm. And it's remarkable what you're all doing. And I can't wait to be a part

1346
01:16:49,680 --> 01:16:54,880
of the future. So congratulations. And it's just the beginning. I think we're just getting started.

1347
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:58,160
I appreciate it. Thank you, Jay. Thank you, David. Thanks for having me on again. Thank you so much.

1348
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:04,320
If this year you're trying to live longer, live happier, live healthier, go and check out my

1349
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:11,040
conversation with the world's biggest longevity doctor, Peter Attia, on how to slow down aging and

1350
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:15,760
why your emotional health is directly impacting your physical health.

1351
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:21,520
Acknowledge that there is surprisingly little known about the relationship between nutrition

1352
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:25,120
and health. And people are going to be shocked to hear that because I think most people think the

1353
01:17:25,120 --> 01:17:34,880
exact opposite.

1354
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:36,880
You
